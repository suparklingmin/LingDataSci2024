[1] FINE SPICED WINE
  _CONDITUM PARADOXUM_

THE COMPOSITION OF [this] EXCELLENT SPICED WINE [is as follows]. INTO
A COPPER BOWL PUT 6 SEXTARII [1] OF HONEY AND 2 SEXTARII OF WINE; HEAT
ON A SLOW FIRE, CONSTANTLY STIRRING THE MIXTURE WITH A WHIP. AT THE
BOILING POINT ADD A DASH OF COLD WINE, RETIRE FROM STOVE AND SKIM.
REPEAT THIS TWICE OR THREE TIMES, LET IT REST TILL THE NEXT DAY, AND
SKIM AGAIN. THEN ADD 4 OZS. OF CRUSHED PEPPER [2], 3 SCRUPLES OF
MASTICH, A DRACHM EACH OF [nard or laurel] LEAVES AND SAFFRON, 5
DRACHMS OF ROASTED DATE STONES CRUSHED AND PREVIOUSLY SOAKED IN WINE
TO SOFTEN THEM. WHEN THIS IS PROPERLY DONE ADD 18 SEXTARII OF LIGHT
WINE. TO CLARIFY IT PERFECTLY, ADD [crushed] CHARCOAL [3] TWICE OR AS
OFTEN AS NECESSARY WHICH WILL DRAW [the residue] TOGETHER [and
carefully strain or filter through the charcoal].

    [1] _Sextarii._ Tor. _partes XV_; G.-V. _pondo XV_;
    List. _partes XV ... pondo lib.... qui continent
    sextarios sex_. One sextarius (a "sixth") equals about
    1-1/2 pint English.

    [2] Pepper. _Piperis uncias IV_--ordinarily our black or
    white pepper grains, but in connection with honey,
    sweets, and so forth, the term "pepper" may just as well
    stand for our allspice, or even for any spicing in
    general.

    [3] Charcoal. Still a favorite filterer for liquors.

    List. Apicius is correct in starting his book with this
    formula, as all meals were started with this sort of
    mixed drink.

    Tor. deviates from the other texts in that he elaborates
    on the cooking process.


[2] HONEY REFRESHER FOR TRAVELERS
  _CONDITUM MELIZOMUM _[1]_ VIATORIUM_

THE WAYFARER'S HONEY REFRESHER (SO CALLED BECAUSE IT GIVES ENDURANCE
AND STRENGTH TO PEDESTRIANS) [2] WITH WHICH TRAVELERS ARE REFRESHED BY
THE WAYSIDE IS MADE IN THIS MANNER: FLAVOR HONEY WITH GROUND PEPPER
AND SKIM. IN THE MOMENT OF SERVING PUT HONEY IN A CUP, AS MUCH AS IS
DESIRED TO OBTAIN THE RIGHT DEGREE OF SWEETNESS, AND MIX SPICED WINE
NOT MORE THAN A NEEDED QUANTITY; ALSO ADD SOME WINE TO THE SPICED
HONEY TO FACILITATE ITS FLOW AND THE MIXING.

    [1] Tor. _Melirhomum_; _non extat_. G.-V. M.
    _perpetuum_, i.e., having good keeping qualities.

    [2] Tor. reads thus whereas others apply "endurance" to
    the honey itself. The honey could not be preserved
    (_perpetuum_) by the addition of pepper. Any addition,
    as a matter of fact, would hasten its deterioration
    unless the honey were boiled and sealed tight, which the
    original takes for granted.



II


[3] ROMAN VERMOUTH
  _ABSINTHIUM ROMANUM_ [1]

ROMAN VERMOUTH [or Absinth] IS MADE THUS: ACCORDING TO THE RECIPE OF
CAMERINUM [2] YOU NEED WORMWOOD FROM SANTO [3] FOR ROMAN VERMOUTH OR,
AS A SUBSTITUTE, WORMWOOD FROM THE PONTUS [4] CLEANED AND CRUSHED, 1
THEBAN OUNCE [5] OF IT, 6 SCRUPLES OF MASTICH, 3 EACH OF [nard]
LEAVES, COSTMARY [6] AND SAFFRON AND 18 QUARTS OF ANY KIND OF MILD
WINE. [Filter cold] CHARCOAL IS NOT REQUIRED BECAUSE OF THE
BITTERNESS.

    [1] G.-V. _Apsinthium_.

    [2] The mention of a name in a recipe is very
    infrequent. Camerinum is a town in Umbria.

    [3] Now Saintonge, Southern France.

    [4] Black Sea Region.

    [5] Weight of indefinite volume, from Thebæ, one of the
    several ancient cities by that name. List. thinks it is
    an Egyptian ounce, and that the author of the recipe
    must be an African.

    [6] Wanting in Tor.; G.-V. _costi scripulos senos_.



III


[4] ROSE WINE [1]
  _ROSATUM_

MAKE ROSE WINE IN THIS MANNER: ROSE PETALS, THE LOWER WHITE PART
REMOVED, SEWED INTO A LINEN BAG AND IMMERSED IN WINE FOR SEVEN DAYS.
THEREUPON ADD A SACK OF NEW PETALS WHICH ALLOW TO DRAW FOR ANOTHER
SEVEN DAYS. AGAIN REMOVE THE OLD PETALS AND REPLACE THEM BY FRESH ONES
FOR ANOTHER WEEK; THEN STRAIN THE WINE THROUGH THE COLANDER. BEFORE
SERVING, ADD HONEY SWEETENING TO TASTE. TAKE CARE THAT ONLY THE BEST
PETALS FREE FROM DEW BE USED FOR SOAKING.

    [1] Used principally as a laxative medicine. List. These
    wines compounded of roses and violets move the bowels
    strongly.


[5] VIOLET WINE
  _VIOLATIUM_

IN A SIMILAR WAY AS ABOVE LIKE THE ROSE WINE VIOLET WINE IS MADE OF
FRESH VIOLETS, AND TEMPERED WITH HONEY, AS DIRECTED.


[6] ROSE WINE WITHOUT [1] ROSES
  _ROSATUM SINE ROSA_

ROSE WINE WITHOUT ROSES IS MADE IN THIS FASHION: A PALM LEAF BASKET
FULL OF FRESH CITRUS LEAVES IS IMMERSED IN THE VAT OF NEW WINE BEFORE
FERMENTATION HAS SET IN. AFTER FORTY DAYS RETIRE THE LEAVES, AND, AS
OCCASION ARISES, SWEETEN THE WINE WITH HONEY, AND PASS IT UP FOR ROSE
WINE.

    [1] A substitute.



IV


[7] LIBURNIAN OIL
  _OLEUM LIBURNICUM_

IN ORDER TO MAKE AN OIL SIMILAR TO THE LIBURNIAN OIL PROCEED AS
FOLLOWS: IN SPANISH OIL PUT [the following mixture of] ELECAMPANE,
CYPRIAN RUSH AND GREEN LAUREL LEAVES THAT ARE NOT TOO OLD, ALL OF IT
CRUSHED AND MACERATED AND REDUCED TO A FINE POWDER. SIFT THIS IN AND
ADD FINELY GROUND SALT AND STIR INDUSTRIOUSLY FOR THREE DAYS OR MORE.
THEN ALLOW TO SETTLE. EVERYBODY WILL TAKE THIS FOR LIBURNIAN OIL. [1]

    [1] Like the above a flagrant case of food adulteration.



V


[8] TO CLARIFY MUDDY WINE
  _VINUM EX ATRO CANDIDUM FACIES_

PUT BEAN MEAL AND THE WHITES OF THREE EGGS IN A MIXING BOWL. MIX
THOROUGHLY WITH A WHIP AND ADD TO THE WINE, STIRRING FOR A LONG TIME.
THE NEXT DAY THE WINE WILL BE CLEAR [1]. ASHES OF VINES HAVE THE SAME
EFFECT.

    [1] Ex Lister whose version we prefer. He says, _Alias
    die erit candidum_ while Tor. adds white salt, saying,
    _sal si adieceris candidum_, same as Tac. This is
    unusual, although the ancients have at times treated
    wine with sea water.



VI


[9] TO IMPROVE A BROTH [1]
  _DE LIQUAMINE EMENDANDO_ [2]

IF BROTH HAS CONTRACTED A BAD ODOR, PLACE A VESSEL UPSIDE DOWN AND
FUMIGATE IT WITH LAUREL AND CYPRESS AND BEFORE VENTILATING [3] IT,
POUR THE BROTH IN THIS VESSEL. IF THIS DOES NOT HELP MATTERS [4] AND
IF THE TASTE IS TOO PRONOUNCED, ADD HONEY AND FRESH SPIKENARD [5] TO
IT; THAT WILL IMPROVE IT. ALSO NEW MUST SHOULD BE LIKEWISE EFFECTIVE
[6].

    [1] List. _Liquamen, id est, garum_. Goll. Fish sauce.

    [2] Tor. _Qui liquamen corruptum corrigatur_.

    [3] Dann. Ventilate it. Goll. Whip the sauce in fresh
    air.

    [4] List., G.-V. _si salsum fuerit_--if this makes it
    too salty--Tor. _si hoc nihil effecerit_.

    [5] Tor. _novem spicam immittas_; List. _Move spica_;
    Goll.-Dann. stir with a whip.

    [6] A classic example of Apician confusion when one
    interpreter reads "s" for "f" and "_novem_" for "_move_"
    and another reads something else. Tor. is more correct
    than the others, but this formula is beyond redemption.
    Fate has decreed that ill-smelling broths shall be
    discarded.



VII


[10] TO KEEP MEATS FRESH WITHOUT SALT FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME
   _UT CARNES SINE SALE QUOVIS TEMPORE RECENTES SINT_

COVER FRESH MEAT WITH HONEY, SUSPEND IT IN A VESSEL. USE AS NEEDED; IN
WINTER IT WILL KEEP BUT IN SUMMER IT WILL LAST ONLY A FEW DAYS. COOKED
MEAT MAY BE TREATED LIKEWISE.


[11] TO KEEP COOKED SIDES OF PORK OR BEEF OR TENDERLOINS
   _CALLUM PORCINUM VEL BUBULUM ET UNGUELLÆ COCTÆ UT DIU DURENT_

PLACE THEM IN A PICKLE OF MUSTARD, VINEGAR, SALT AND HONEY, COVERING
MEAT ENTIRELY, AND WHEN READY TO USE YOU'LL BE SURPRISED.

    V. Method still popular today for pickling raw meats.
    The originals treat of cooked meats (Tor. _nucula
    elixa_; G.-V. _unguellæ coctæ_; Tac. _nucella cocta_).
    Dispensing with the honey, we use more spices, whole
    pepper, cloves, bay leaves, also onions and root
    vegetables. Sometimes a little sugar and wine is added
    to this preparation which the French call _marinade_ and
    the Germans _Sauerbraten-Einlage_.



VIII


[12] TO MAKE SALT MEAT SWEET
   _UT CARNEM SALSAM DULCEM FACIAS_

YOU CAN MAKE SALT MEATS SWEET BY FIRST BOILING THEM IN MILK AND THEN
FINISHING THEM IN WATER.

    V. Method still in practice today. Salt mackerel, finnan
    haddie, etc., are parboiled in milk prior to being
    boiled in water or broiled or fried.



IX


[13] TO KEEP FRIED FISH
   _UT PISCES FRICTI DIU DURENT_

IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEY ARE FRIED POUR HOT VINEGAR OVER THEM.

    Dann. Exactly as we today with fried herring and river
    lamprey.


[14] TO KEEP OYSTERS
   _OSTREA UT DIU DURENT_

FUMIGATE A VINEGAR BARREL WITH PITCH [1], WASH IT OUT WITH VINEGAR AND
STACK THE OYSTERS IN IT [2]

    [1] Tor. _vas ascernum_, corrected on margin, _ab
    aceto_. List. _vas ab aceto_, which is correct. G.-V.
    _lavas ab aceto_; V. the oysters? unthinkable! Besides
    it would do no good.

    [2] Goll. Take oysters out of the shell, place in
    vinegar barrel, sprinkle with laurel berries, fine salt,
    close tight. V. Goll's authority for this version is
    not found in our originals.

    V. There is no way to keep live oysters fresh except in
    their natural habitat--salt water. Today we pack them in
    barrels, feed them with oatmeal, put weights on them--of
    no avail. The only way English oysters could have
    arrived fresh in Imperial Rome was in specially
    constructed bottoms of the galleys.



X


[15] MAKING A LITTLE LASER GO A LONG WAY
   _UT NUCIA _[1]_ LASERIS TOTO TEMPORE UTARIS_

PUT THE LASER [2] IN A SPACIOUS GLASS VESSEL; IMMERSE ABOUT 20 PINE
KERNELS [pignolia nuts]

IF YOU NEED LASER FLAVOR, TAKE SOME NUTS, CRUSH THEM; THEY WILL IMPART
TO YOUR DISH AN ADMIRABLE FLAVOR. REPLACE THE USED NUTS WITH A LIKE
NUMBER OF FRESH ONES [3]

    [1] List. and G.-V. _uncia_--ounce. Making an ounce of
    laser go a long way. Tor. _nucea_; Tac. _nucia_. Lister,
    fond of hair-splitting, is irreconcilably opposed to
    Tor., and berates Caspar Barthius for defending Tor.
    List. _Quam futilis sit in multis labor C. Barthii ut
    menda Torini passim sustineat, vel ex hoc loco
    intelligere licet: Et enim lege modo uncia pro nucea cum
    Humelbergio, & ista omnia glossemata vana sunt._

    V. both readings, _uncia_ or _nucia_ are permissible,
    and make very little difference. We side with Tor. and
    Tac. because it takes more than an ounce of laser to
    carry out this experiment.

    [2] _Laser_, _laserpitium_, cf. dictionary.

    [3] V. This article illustrates how sparingly the
    ancients used the strong and pungent laser flavor [by
    some believed to be _asa foetida_] because it was very
    expensive, but principally because the Roman cooks
    worked economically and knew how to treat spices and
    flavors judiciously. This article alone should disperse
    for all time all stories of ancient Rome's extravagance
    in flavoring and seasoning dishes. It reminds of the
    methods used by European cooks to get the utmost use out
    of the expensive vanilla bean: they bury the bean in a
    can of powdered sugar. They will use the sugar only
    which has soon acquired a delicate vanilla perfume, and
    will replace the used sugar by a fresh supply. This is
    by far a superior method to using the often rank and
    adulterated "vanilla extract" readily bottled. It is
    more gastronomical and more economical. Most commercial
    extracts are synthetic, some injurious. To believe that
    any of them impart to the dishes the true flavor desired
    is of course ridiculous. The enormous consumption of
    such extracts however, is characteristic of our
    industrialized barbarism which is so utterly indifferent
    to the fine points in food. Today it is indeed hard for
    the public to obtain a real vanilla bean.

    Cf. also notes regarding flavoring to Nos. 276-7, 345
    and 385.



XI


[16] TO MAKE HONEY CAKES LAST
   _UT DULCIA DE MELLE DIU DURENT_

TO MAKE HONEY CAKES THAT WILL KEEP TAKE WHAT THE GREEKS CALL YEAST [1]
AND MIX IT WITH THE FLOUR AND THE HONEY AT THE TIME WHEN MAKING THE
COOKY DOUGH.

    [1] Tor. and Tac. _nechon_; G.-V. _cnecon_; Dann.
    _penion_.


[17] SPOILED HONEY MADE GOOD
   _UT MEL MALUM BONUM FACIAS_

HOW BAD HONEY MAY BE TURNED INTO A SALEABLE ARTICLE IS TO MIX ONE PART
OF THE SPOILED HONEY WITH TWO PARTS OF GOOD HONEY.

    List. _indigna fraus_! V. We all agree with Lister that
    this is contemptible business. This casts another light
    on the ancients' methods of food adulteration.


[18] TO TEST SPOILED HONEY
   _MEL CORRUPTUM UT PROBES_

IMMERSE ELENCAMPANE IN HONEY AND LIGHT IT; IF GOOD, IT WILL BURN
BRIGHTLY.



XII


[19] TO KEEP GRAPES
   _UVÆ UT DIU SERVENTUR_

TAKE PERFECT GRAPES FROM THE VINES, PLACE THEM IN A VESSEL AND POUR
RAIN WATER OVER THEM THAT HAS BEEN BOILED DOWN ONE THIRD OF ITS
VOLUME. THE VESSEL MUST BE PITCHED AND SEALED WITH PLASTER, AND MUST
BE KEPT IN A COOL PLACE TO WHICH THE SUN HAS NO ACCESS. TREATED IN
THIS MANNER, THE GRAPES WILL BE FRESH WHENEVER YOU NEED THEM. YOU CAN
ALSO SERVE THIS WATER AS HONEY MEAD TO THE SICK.

ALSO, IF YOU COVER THE GRAPES WITH BARLEY [bran] YOU WILL FIND THEM
SOUND AND UNINJURED.

    V. We keep grapes in cork shavings, bran and saw dust.


[20] TO KEEP POMEGRANATES
   _UT MALA GRANATA DIU DURENT_ [1]

STEEP THEM INTO HOT [sea] WATER, TAKE THEM OUT IMMEDIATELY AND HANG
THEM UP. [Tor.] THEY WILL KEEP.

    [1] Tor. _conditura malorum Punicorum_; Tac. _mala
    granata_; G.-V. _mala et mala granata_.


[21] TO KEEP QUINCES
   _UT MALA CYDONIA DIU SERVENTUR_

PICK OUT PERFECT QUINCES WITH STEMS [1] AND LEAVES. PLACE THEM IN A
VESSEL, POUR OVER HONEY AND DEFRUTUM [2] AND YOU'LL PRESERVE THEM FOR
A LONG TIME [3].

    [1] V. Excellent idea, for the stems, if removed, would
    leave a wound in the fruit for the air to penetrate and
    to start fermentation. Cf. also the next formula.

    [2] G.-V. _defritum_, from _defervitum_; _defrutum_ is
    new wine, spiced, boiled down to one half of its volume.

    [3] This precept would not keep the fruit very long
    unless protected by a closefitting cover and
    sterilization. Cf. No. 24.


[22] TO PRESERVE FRESH FIGS, APPLES, PLUMS, PEARS AND CHERRIES
   _FICUM RECENTEM, MALA, PRUNA, PIRA, CERASIA UT DIU SERVES_

SELECT THEM ALL VERY CAREFULLY WITH THE STEMS ON [1] AND PLACE THEM IN
HONEY SO THEY DO NOT TOUCH EACH OTHER.

    [1] See the preceding formula.


[23] TO KEEP CITRON
   _CITRIA UT DIU DURENT_ [1]

PLACE THEM IN A GLASS [2] VESSEL WHICH IS SEALED WITH PLASTER AND
SUSPENDED.

    [1] Tor. _conditura malorum Medicorum quæ et citria
    dicuntur_. V. Not quite identified. Fruit coming from
    Asia Minor, Media or Persia, one of the many varieties
    of citrus fruit. Probably citron because of their size.
    Goll. Lemon-apples; Dann. lemons (oranges). List.
    _Scilicet mala, quæ Dioscorides Persica quoque & Medica,
    & citromala, Plinius item Assyria appellari dicit_.

    [2] G.-V. _vas vitreum_; Tac. and Tor. _vas citrum_; V.
    a glass vessel could not be successfully sealed with
    plaster paris, and the experiment would fail; cf. note 3
    to No. 21.


[24] TO KEEP MULBERRIES
   _MORA UT DIU DURENT_

MULBERRIES, IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM, MUST BE LAID INTO THEIR OWN JUICE
MIXED WITH NEW WINE [boiled down to one half] IN A GLASS VESSEL AND
MUST BE WATCHED ALL THE TIME [so that they do not spoil].

    V. This and the foregoing formulæ illustrate the
    ancients' attempts at preserving foods, and they betray
    their ignorance of "processing" by heating them in
    hermetically sealed vessels, the principle of which was
    not discovered until 1810 by Appert which started the
    now gigantic industry of canning.


[25] TO KEEP POT HERBS
   [_H_]_OLERA UT DIU SERVENTUR_

PLACE SELECTED POT HERBS, NOT TOO MATURE, IN A PITCHED VESSEL.


[26] TO PRESERVE SORREL OR SOUR DOCK
   _LAPÆ _[1]_ UT DIU SERVENTUR_

TRIM AND CLEAN [the vegetable] PLACE THEM TOGETHER SPRINKLE MYRTLE
BERRIES BETWEEN, COVER WITH HONEY AND VINEGAR.

ANOTHER WAY: PREPARE MUSTARD HONEY AND VINEGAR ALSO SALT AND COVER
THEM WITH THE SAME.

    [1] The kind of vegetable to be treated here has not
    been sufficiently identified. List. and G.-V.
    _rapæ_--turnips--from _rapus_, seldom _rapa_,--a rape,
    turnip, navew. Tac. and Tor. _Lapæ_ (_lapathum_), kind
    of sorrel, monk's rhubarb, dock. Tor. explaining at
    length: _conditura Rumicis quod lapathon Græci, Latini
    Lapam quoque dicunt_.

    V. Tor. is correct, or nearly so. Turnips, in the first
    place, are not in need of any special method of
    preservation. They keep very well in a cool,
    well-ventilated place; in fact they would hardly keep
    very long if treated in the above manner. These
    directions are better applied to vegetables like dock or
    monk's rhubarb. Lister, taking Humelbergii word for it,
    accepts "turnips" as the only truth; but he has little
    occasion to assail Torinus as he does: _Torinus lapam
    legit, & nullibi temeritatem suam atque inscientiam
    magis ostendit._

    Now, if Torinus, according to Lister, "nowhere displays
    more nerve and ignorance" we can well afford to trust
    Torinus in cases such as this.


[27] TO KEEP TRUFFLES
   _TUBERA UT DIU SERVENTUR_

THE TRUFFLES WHICH MUST NOT BE TOUCHED BY WATER ARE PLACED ALTERNATELY
IN DRY SAWDUST; SEAL THE VESSEL WITH PLASTER AND DEPOSIT IT IN A COOL
PLACE.

    Dann. Clean [peel] the truffles ... in another vessel
    place the peelings, seal the vessels.... V. this would
    be the ruin of the truffles, unless they were
    "processed" in the modern way. Our originals have
    nothing that would warrant this interpretation.


[28] TO KEEP HARD-SKINNED PEACHES
   _DURACINA PERSICA UT DIU DURENT_

SELECT THE BEST AND PUT THEM IN BRINE. THE NEXT DAY REMOVE THEM AND
RINSING THEM CAREFULLY SET THEM IN PLACE IN A VESSEL, SPRINKLE WITH
SALT AND SATURY AND IMMERSE IN VINEGAR.



XIII


[29] SALTS FOR MANY [ILLS]
   _SALES CONDITOS AD MULTA_

THESE SPICED SALTS ARE USED AGAINST INDIGESTION, TO MOVE THE BOWELS,
AGAINST ALL ILLNESS, AGAINST PESTILENCE AS WELL AS FOR THE PREVENTION
OF COLDS. THEY ARE VERY GENTLE INDEED AND MORE HEALTHFUL THAN YOU
WOULD EXPECT. [Tor. MAKE THEM IN THIS MANNER]: 1 LB. OF COMMON SALT
GROUND, 2 LBS. OF AMMONIAC SALT, GROUND [List. AND G.-V. 3 OZS. WHITE
PEPPER, 2 OZS. GINGER] 1 OZ. [Tor. 1-1/2 OZ.] OF AMINEAN BRYONY, 1 OF
THYME SEED AND 1 OF CELERY SEED [Tor. 1-1/2 OZ.] IF YOU DON'T WANT TO
USE CELERY SEED TAKE INSTEAD 3 OZS. OF PARSLEY [SEED] 3 OZS. OF
ORIGANY, 1 OZ. OF SAFFRON [List. and G.-V. ROCKET] 3 OZS. OF BLACK
PEPPER [1] 1-1/2 OZS. ROCKET SEED, 2 OZS. OF MARJORAM [List. and G.-V.
CRETAN HYSSOP] 2 OZS. OF NARD LEAVES, 2 OZS. OF PARSLEY [SEED] AND 2
OZS. OF ANISE SEED.

    [1] In view of the white pepper as directed above, this
    seems superfluous. White pepper and ginger omitted by
    Tor.

    This is one of the few medical formulæ found in Apicius.

    Edward Brandt, _op. cit._, Apiciana No. 29, points out
    the similarity of this formula with that of the
    physician, Marcellus, who lived at Rome under Nero,
    Marcell. med. 30, 51.



XIV


[30] TO KEEP GREEN OLIVES
   _OLIVAS VIRIDES SERVARE_

TO KEEP OLIVES, FRESH FROM THE TREE, IN A MANNER ENABLING YOU TO MAKE
OIL FROM THEM ANY TIME YOU DESIRE JUST PLACE THEM [in brine]. [1]
HAVING BEEN KEPT THUS FOR SOME TIME THE OLIVES MAY BE USED AS IF THEY
HAD JUST COME OFF THE TREE FRESH IF YOU DESIRE TO MAKE GREEN OIL OF
THEM.

    [1] The original does not state the liquid in which the
    olives are to be placed.

    Hum. _in illud, legendum puto, in muriam_.

    Hum. is correct. Olives are preserved in brine to this
    day.

    Schuch's version of this formula (his No. 27) follows
    our No. 28, together with his own No. 28, To Keep
    Damascene Plums [etc.] which is wanting in List., G.-V.,
    and all the earlier editions because it is from the
    codex Salmasianus and will be found among the Excerpts
    of Vinidarius at the end of the Apician recipes.

XVI


[31] LASER FLAVOR
   _LASERATUM_

[Tor.] LASER IS PREPARED IN THIS MANNER: LASER (WHICH IS ALSO CALLED
LASERPITIUM BY THE ROMANS, WHILE THE GREEKS CALL IT SILPHION) FROM
CYRENE [1] OR FROM PARTHIA [2] IS DISSOLVED IN LUKEWARM MODERATELY
ACID BROTH; OR PEPPER, PARSLEY, DRY MINT, LASER ROOT, HONEY, VINEGAR
AND BROTH [are ground, compounded and dissolved together].

    [1] Cyrene, a province in Africa, reputed for its fine
    flavored laser.

    [2] Parthia, Asiatic country, still supplying _asa
    fœtida_.

    The African root furnishing laser was exterminated by
    the demand for it. Cf. Laser in Index.


[32] ANOTHER [LASER]
   _ALITER_

[ANOTHER LASER FLAVOR WHICH TAKES] PEPPER, CARAWAY, ANISE, PARSLEY,
DRY MINT, THE LEAVES [1] OF SILPHIUM, MALOBATHRUM [2] INDIAN
SPIKENARD, A LITTLE COSTMARY, HONEY, VINEGAR AND BROTH.

    [1] Tor. _Silphij folium_; List. _Sylphium, folium_;
    G.-V. _Silfi, folium_, the latter two interpretations
    meaning _silphium_ (laser) _and leaves_ (either nard or
    bay leaves) while both Tor. and Tac. (_silfii folium_)
    mean the leaves of _silphium_ plant.

    [2] _Malobathrum_, _malobatrum_, _malabathrum_--leaves
    of an Indian tree, wild cinnamon.



XVII


[33] WINE SAUCE FOR TRUFFLES
   _ŒNOGARUM _[1]_ IN TUBERA_

PEPPER, LOVAGE, CORIANDER, RUE, BROTH, HONEY AND A LITTLE OIL.

ANOTHER WAY: THYME, SATURY, PEPPER, LOVAGE, HONEY, BROTH AND OIL.

    [1] Also _Elæogarum_.

    V. Directions wanting whether the above ingredients are
    to be added to the already prepared _garum_, which see
    in dictionary. Gollmer gives the following direction for
    _garum_: Boil a _sextarium_ of anchovies and 3
    _sextarii_ of good wine until it is thick _purée_.
    Strain this through a hair sieve and keep it in glass
    flask for future use. This formula, according to Goll.
    should have followed our No. 9; but we find no authority
    for it in the original.

    _Oenogarum_ proper would be a _garum_ prepared with
    wine, but in this instance it is the broth in which the
    truffles were cooked that is to be flavored with the
    above ingredients. There is no need and no mention of
    _garum_ proper. Thus prepared it might turn out to be a
    sensible sauce for truffles in the hands of a good
    practitioner.

    Note the etymology of the word "garum," now serving as a
    generic name for "sauce" which originally stood for a
    compound of the fish _garus_.

[41] MINCED DISHES
   _ISICIA_

THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF MINCED DISHES [1] SEAFOOD MINCES [2] ARE MADE
OF SEA-ONION, OR SEA CRAB-FISH, LOBSTER, CUTTLE-FISH, INK FISH, SPINY
LOBSTER, SCALLOPS AND OYSTERS [3]. THE FORCEMEAT IS SEASONED WITH
LOVAGE [4], PEPPER, CUMIN AND LASER ROOT.

    [1] Tor. Sentence wanting in other texts. V. Forcemeats,
    minced meats, sausage. Tor. _Hysitia_, from _Isicia_.
    This term is derived from _insicium_, from _salsicium_,
    from _salsum insicium_, cut salt meat; old French
    _salcisse_, _saulcisse_, modern French _saucisse_,
    meaning sausage. This is a confirmation of the meaning
    of the word _salsum_--meaning primarily salt meat, bacon
    in particular. It has survived in modern French
    terminology in _salés_ more specially _petits
    salés_--small rashers of bacon. _Salsum_ has caused much
    confusion in some later formulæ. Cf. notes to Nos. 148,
    150, 152.

    [2] V. fish forcemeats, fish balls, fish cakes and
    similar preparations.

    [3] Scallops and oysters wanting in List. and G.-V.

    [4] Wanting in List.


[42] CUTTLE-FISH CROQUETTES
   _ISICIA DE LOLLIGINE_ [1]

THE MEAT IS SEPARATED FROM BONES, SKIN [and refuse] CHOPPED FINE AND
POUNDED IN THE MORTAR. SHAPE THE FORCEMEAT INTO NEAT CROQUETTES [2]
AND COOK THEM IN LIQUAMEN [3].

THEY ARE DISPLAYED NICELY ON A LARGE DISH.

    V. This formula plainly calls for fish balls braised or
    stewed in broth. Ordinarily we would boil the fish first
    and then separate the meat from the bones, shred or chop
    it fine, bind with cream sauce, flour and eggs; some add
    potatoes as a binder, and fry.

    [1] G.-V. _lolligine_; Tor. _loligine_, which is
    correctly spelled.

    [2] Tac. and Tor. _in pulmento tundes_. G.-V. _fulmento_
    which is wrong. _Pulmentum_, abbreviated for
    _pulpamentum_, from _pulpa_. It means a fleshy piece of
    fish or meat, a tid-bit.

    [3] The original says _in liquamine fricatur_--fry in
    l., which is impossible in the sense of the word,
    frying. Either "frying" here stands for cooking,
    stewing, braising, poaching, or else the so mysterious
    _liquamen_ must here mean deep fat. Most likely these
    fish forcemeat balls were fried in olive oil. Cf. ℞
    No. 46.


[43] LOBSTER OR CRABMEAT CROQUETTES
   _ISICIA DE SCILLIS VEL DE CAMMARIS AMPLIS_ [1]

THE SHELLS OF THE LOBSTERS OR CRABS [which are cooked] ARE BROKEN, THE
MEAT EXTRACTED FROM THE HEAD AND POUNDED IN THE MORTAR WITH PEPPER AND
THE BEST KIND OF BROTH. THIS PULP [is shaped into neat little cakes
which are fried] AND SERVED UP NICELY [2].

    [1] _Scilla_ or _squilla_, squill, sea-onion, also a
    crab, _cammarus amplus_, large lobster, langouste, spiny
    lobster.

    [2] The original omits the mode of cooking the fish. A
    case where it is taken for granted that the shellfish is
    boiled in water alive. The broth (_liquamen_) is a thick
    fish sauce in this case, serving as a binder for the
    meat, conforming to present methods.

    Dann. Fill this into sausage casing. There is no
    authority for this.


[44] LIVER KROMESKIS
   _OMENTATA_ [1]

OMENTATA ARE MADE IN THIS MANNER: [lightly] FRY PORK LIVER, REMOVE
SKIN AND SINEWS FIRST [2]. CRUSH PEPPER AND RUE IN A MORTAR WITH [a
little] BROTH, THEN ADD THE LIVER, POUND AND MIX. THIS PULP SHAPE INTO
SMALL SAUSAGE, WRAP EACH IN CAUL AND LAUREL LEAVES AND HANG THEM UP TO
BE SMOKED. WHENEVER YOU WANT AND WHEN READY TO ENJOY THEM TAKE THEM
OUT OF THE SMOKE, FRY THEM AGAIN, AND ADD GRAVY [3].

    [1] From _omentum_--caul, the membrane enclosing the
    bowels. Hence "omen." Minced meats wrapped in caul and
    fried are kromeskis in kitchen terminology.

    [2] First--an after thought so characteristic in
    culinary literature, proof enough that this formula
    originated in a kitchen. The _ante tamen_ of the
    original belongs to this sentence, not to the next, as
    the editors have it.

    [3] Wanting in G.-V. The original continues without
    interruption to the next, an entirely new formula.


[45] [BRAIN SAUSAGE]
   [_ISICIA DE CEREBELLIS_] [1]

PUT IN THE MORTAR PEPPER, LOVAGE AND ORIGANY, MOISTEN WITH BROTH AND
RUB; ADD COOKED BRAINS AND MIX DILIGENTLY SO THAT THERE BE NO LUMPS.
INCORPORATE FIVE EGGS AND CONTINUE MIXING WELL TO HAVE A GOOD
FORCEMEAT WHICH YOU MAY THIN WITH BROTH. SPREAD THIS OUT IN A METAL
PAN, COOK, AND WHEN COOKED [cold] UNMOULD IT ONTO A CLEAN TABLE. CUT
INTO HANDY SIZE. [Now prepare a sauce] PUT IN THE MORTAR PEPPER,
LOVAGE AND ORIGANY, CRUSH, MIX WITH BROTH PUT INTO A SAUCE PAN, BOIL,
THICKEN AND STRAIN. HEAT THE PIECES OF BRAIN PUDDING IN THIS SAUCE
THOROUGHLY, DISH THEM UP, SPRINKLED WITH PEPPER, IN A MUSHROOM DISH
[2].

    [1] The Original has no title for this dish.

    [2] List. and G.-V. here start the next formula, but
    Tor. continues without interruption. Cf. Note 2 to No.
    46.


[46] A DISH OF SCALLOPS
   _ISICIA EX SPONDYLIS_ [1]

[Lightly] COOK SCALLOPS [or the firm part of oysters] REMOVE THE HARD
AND OBJECTIONABLE PARTS, MINCE THE MEAT VERY FINE, MIX THIS WITH
COOKED SPELT AND EGGS, SEASON WITH PEPPER, [shape into croquettes and
wrap] IN CAUL, FRY, UNDERLAY A RICH FISH SAUCE AND SERVE AS A
DELICIOUS ENTRÉE [2].

    [1] Sch. _sfondilis_; G.-V. _sphondylis_; List.
    _spongiolis_. According to Lister, this is a dish of
    mushrooms, but he is wrong. He directs to remove sinews
    when mushrooms haven't any, but shellfish have. Torinus
    is correct. Gollmer makes the same mistake, believing
    _spondyli_ to be identical with _spongioli_. He and
    Danneil take _elixata_ for "choice" when this plainly
    means "cooked." If one were not sure of either word, the
    nature of the subject would leave no room for any doubt.
    Cf. note 1 to Nos. 115-121.

    [2] We may find a reason for the combination of these
    last three distinctly different formulæ into one article
    in the following explanation. It is possible that these
    dishes were served together as one course, even on one
    platter, thus constituting a single dish, as it were.
    Such a dish would strongly resemble platters of
    "_fritures_" and "_fritto misto_" (mixed fried foods)
    esteemed in France and Italy. We, too, have "Shore
    Dinners" and other "Combination Platters" with lobster,
    crabs, scallops, shrimps, mushrooms, tomatoes--each
    article prepared separately, but when served together
    will form an integral part of ONE dish.

    The above formulæ, though somewhat incomplete, are good
    and gastronomically correct. A combination of these
    _isicia_ such as we here suggest would be entirely
    feasible and would in fact make a dish of great
    refinement, taxing the magiric artist's skill to the
    utmost. We would class them among the _entremets chauds_
    which are often used on a buffet table or as hot _hors
    d'œuvres_.


[47] ANOTHER KIND OF KROMESKIS [1]
   _ALITER ISICIA OMENTATA_

FINELY CUT PULP [of pork] IS GROUND WITH THE HEARTS [2] OF WINTER
WHEAT AND DILUTED WITH WINE. FLAVOR LIGHTLY WITH PEPPER AND BROTH AND
IF YOU LIKE ADD A MODERATE QUANTITY OF [myrtle] BERRIES ALSO CRUSHED,
AND AFTER YOU HAVE ADDED CRUSHED NUTS AND PEPPER [3] SHAPE THE
FORCEMEAT INTO SMALL ROLLS, WRAP THESE IN CAUL, FRY, AND SERVE WITH
WINE GRAVY.

    [1] Wanting in Lister.

    [2] Fine wheat flour, cream of wheat.

    [3] Either pepper corns or allspice.

    The original leaves us in doubt as to the kind of meat
    to be used, if any.



II


[48] DUMPLINGS OF PHEASANT
   _ISICIA PLENA_

[Lightly roast choice] FRESH PHEASANTS [cut them into dice and mix
these with a] STIFF FORCEMEAT MADE OF THE FAT AND THE TRIMMINGS OF THE
PHEASANT, SEASON WITH PEPPER, BROTH AND REDUCED WINE, SHAPE INTO
CROQUETTES OR SPOON DUMPLINGS, AND POACH IN HYDROGARUM [water seasoned
with garum, or even plain salt water].


[49] DUMPLINGS AND HYDROGARUM
   _HYDROGARATA ISICIA_

CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE AND JUST A SUSPICION OF PELLITORY, MOISTEN WITH
STOCK AND WELL WATER, ALLOW IT TO DRAW, PLACE IT IN A SAUCE PAN, BOIL
IT DOWN, AND STRAIN. POACH YOUR LITTLE DUMPLINGS OF FORCEMEAT IN THIS
LIQUOR AND WHEN THEY ARE DONE SERVE IN A DISH FOR ISICIA, TO BE SIPPED
AT THE TABLE.


[50] CHICKEN FORCEMEAT
   _ISICIA DE PULLO_

[Raw] CHICKEN MEAT, 1 LB. OF DARNEL [1] MEAL, ONE QUARTER PINT OF
STOCK AND ONE HALF OUNCE OF PEPPER.

    [1] Tor. _lolæ floris_; Hum.-List. and G.-V. _olei
    floris_--virgin olive oil?--first choice flour? Goll.
    olive (violet?) flowers; Dann. Olive oil.

    The suggestion of oil is plausible because of the lack
    of fat in chicken meat, but the quantity--1 lb.--is out
    of question. Moreover, the binder would be lacking. This
    is found in the Torinus rendering.

    His _lolæ floris_ should read _lolii_--from
    _lolium_--darnel rye grass or ray grass which was
    supposed to have intoxicating qualities, injurious to
    the eye sight.--Ovid and Plautus. The seeds of this
    grass were supposed to possess narcotic properties but
    recent researches have cast doubt upon this theory.

    A little butter, fresh cream and eggs are the proper
    ingredients for chicken forcemeat. Any kind of flour for
    binding the forcemeat would cheapen the dish. Yet some
    modern forcemeats (sausage) contain as much as fifty
    percent of some kind of meal. The most effective is that
    of the soya bean which is not starchy.


[51] CHICKEN BROTH ANOTHER STYLE
   _ALITER DE PULLO_

CHICKEN MEAT, 31 PEPPERCORNS CRUSHED, 1 CHOENIX [1] FULL OF THE VERY
BEST STOCK, A LIKE AMOUNT OF BOILED MUST AND ELEVEN MEASURES [2] OF
WATER. [Put this in a sauce pan] PLACE IT UPON THE FIRE TO SEETH AND
EVAPORATE SLOWLY.

    [1] V. 2 _sextarii_; Tor. _chœnicem, cenlicem_; List.
    _calicem_.

    [2] _chœnices_?--left in doubt.

    This seems to be a chicken broth, or essence for a sauce
    or perhaps a medicine. Torinus mentions the chicken
    meat, the others do not.

    The original without interruption continues to describe
    the _isicium simplex_ which has nothing to do with the
    above.


[52] PLAIN DUMPLING WITH BROTH
   _ISICIUM SIMPLEX_

TO 1 ACETABULUM [1] OF STOCK [2] ADD 7 OF WATER, A LITTLE GREEN
CELERY, A LITTLE SPOONFUL OF GROUND PEPPER, AND BOIL THIS WITH THE
SAUSAGE MEAT OR DUMPLINGS. IF YOU INTEND TAKING THIS TO MOVE THE
BOWELS THE SEDIMENT SALTS [3] OF HYDROGARUM HAVE TO BE ADDED [4].

    [1] A measure, 15 Attic drachms.

    [2] _liquamen_.

    [3] Tor. _pectines, alias peces hydrogaro conditi_;
    List. _sales_; G.-V. _fæces_.

    [4] V. The formula is unintelligible, like No. 52 and
    others, perhaps just another example of medicinal
    cookery, dishes not only intended to nourish the body
    but to cure also certain ills. Authors like Hannah
    Wolley (The Queen-like Closet, London, 1675) and as late
    as the middle of the 18th century pride themselves in
    giving such quasi-Apician formulæ.


[53] [Rank of] DISHES
   _ISICIA_

[Entrées of] PEACOCK OCCUPY THE FIRST RANK, PROVIDED THEY BE DRESSED
IN SUCH MANNER THAT THE HARD AND TOUGH PARTS BE TENDER. THE SECOND
PLACE [in the estimation of the Gourmets] HAVE DISHES MADE OF RABBIT
[1] THIRD SPINY LOBSTER [2] FOURTH COMES CHICKEN AND FIFTH YOUNG PIG.

    [1] List. and G.-V. Pheasant.

    [2] Wanting in the above. Dann. Crane fourth.

    _Isicia_, like in the foregoing formula, commences to
    become a generic term for "dishes."


[54] POTTED ENTRÉES
   _ISICIA AMULATA AB AHENO_ [1]

GROUND PEPPER, LOVAGE, ORIGANY, VERY LITTLE SILPHIUM, A PINCH OF
GINGER AND A TRIFLE OF HONEY AND A LITTLE STOCK. [Put on the fire,
and when boiling] ADD THE ISICIA [sausage, meat balls and so forth] TO
THIS BROTH AND COOK THOROUGHLY. FINALLY THICKEN THE GRAVY WITH ROUX
[2] BY SOWING IT IN SLOWLY AND STIRRING FROM THE BOTTOM UP [3].

    [1] Tor. _multa ab alieno_; Brandt _[a]mul[a]ta ab
    aheno_; List. _amylata_--French: _liés_. _Ab aheno_--out
    of the pot.

    [2] French, for a mixture of wheat or rice flour with
    fats or liquids to thicken fluids. _Amylum_, or _amulum_
    which hereafter will occur frequently in the original
    does not cover the ground as well as the French term
    _roux_. The quality of the "binder" depends upon the
    material in hand. Sometimes the fat and flour are
    parched, sometimes they are used raw. Sometimes the
    flour is diluted with water and used in that form.

    [3] List. and G.-V. _sorbendum_; Tor. _subruendum_.


[55] ANOTHER [THICK ENTRÉE GRAVY]
   _ALITER_

GRIND PEPPER WHICH HAS BEEN SOAKED OVERNIGHT, ADD SOME MORE STOCK AND
WORK IT INTO A SMOOTH PASTE; THEREUPON ADD QUINCE-APPLE CIDER, BOILED
DOWN ONE HALF, THAT IS WHICH HAS EVAPORATED IN THE HEAT OF THE SUN TO
THE CONSISTENCY OF HONEY. IF THIS IS NOT AT HAND, ADD FIG WINE [1]
CONCENTRATE WHICH THE ROMANS CALL "COLOR" [2]. NOW THICKEN THE GRAVY
WITH ROUX OR WITH SOAKED RICE FLOUR AND FINISH IT ON A GENTLE FIRE.

    [1] Tor. _cammarum_, which should read _caricarum_--wine
    of Carica figs.

    [2] V. the Roman equivalent for "_singe_," "monkey,"
    "_Affe_,"--(the _vulgo_ French is literally translated
    into and in actual use in other languages) caramel color
    made of burnt sugar to give gravies a palatable
    appearance. Cf. No. 73.

    The reference by the original to "which the Romans call
    'color'" indicates, according to Brandt, that this
    formula is NOT of ROMAN origin but probably a
    translation into Latin from a Greek cookery book.

    This is an interesting suggestion, and it could be
    elaborated on to say that the entire Apicius is NOT of
    Roman origin. But why should the Greeks who in their
    balmy days were so far in advance of Rome in culinary
    matters go there for such information?

    It is more likely that this reference to Rome comes from
    the Italian provinces or the colonies, regions which
    naturally would look to Rome for guidance in such
    matters.


[56] ANOTHER AMULATUM
   _AMULATUM ALITER_

DISJOINT A CHICKEN AND BONE IT. PLACE THE PIECES IN A STEW PAN WITH
LEEKS, DILL AND SALT [water or stock] WHEN WELL DONE ADD PEPPER AND
CELERY SEED, THICKEN WITH RICE [1] ADD STOCK, A DASH OF RAISIN WINE OR
MUST, STIR WELL, SERVE WITH THE ENTRÉES.

    [1] G.-V. _oryzam_; Tor. ditto (and on margin) _oridam_;
    Hum. _oridiam legendum orindam_--a kind of bread. Dann.
    and Goll. rice flour.

    In a general way the ancient formula corresponds exactly
    to our present chicken fricassée.


[57] SPELT OR FARINA PUDDING
   _APOTHERMUM_

BOIL SPELT WITH [Tor. PIGNOLIA] NUTS AND PEELED ALMONDS [1] [G.-V.
AND] IMMERSED IN [boiling] WATER AND WASHED WITH WHITE CLAY SO THAT
THEY APPEAR PERFECTLY WHITE, ADD RAISINS, [flavor with] CONDENSED WINE
OR RAISIN WINE AND SERVE IT IN A ROUND DISH WITH CRUSHED [2] [nuts,
fruit, bread or cake crumbs] SPRINKLED OVER IT [3].

    [1] V. We peel almonds in the same manner; the white
    clay treatment is new to us.

    G.-V. and--which is confusing.

    [2] The original: _confractum_--crushed, but what? G.-V.
    pepper, for which there is neither authority nor reason.
    A wine sauce would go well with it or crushed fruit.
    List. and Goll. Breadcrumbs.

    [3] This is a perfectly good pudding--one of the very
    few desserts in Apicius. With a little sweetening
    (supplied probably by the condensed wine) and some
    grated lemon for flavor it is quite acceptable as a
    dessert.


[58] DE AMBOLATO CAP. IIII

    Ex Torinus, not mentioned by the other editors. The
    sense of this word is not clear. It must be a recipe or
    a chapter the existence of which was known to Torinus,
    for he says: "This entire chapter is wanting in our
    copy."



III


[59] A DISH OF SOW'S MATRIX
   _VULVULÆ BOTELLI_ [1]

ENTRÉES [2] OF SOW'S MATRIX [3] ARE MADE THUS: CRUSH PEPPER AND CUMIN
WITH TWO SMALL HEADS OF LEEK, PEELED, ADD TO THIS PULP RUE, BROTH [and
the sow's matrix or fresh pork] CHOP, [or crush in mortar very fine]
THEN ADD TO THIS [forcemeat] INCORPORATING WELL PEPPER GRAINS AND
[pine] NUTS [4] FILL THE CASING [5] AND BOIL IN WATER [with] OIL AND
BROTH [for seasoning] AND A BUNCH OF LEEKS AND DILL.

    [1] G.-V. _Vulvulæ Botelli_; Sch. _Vulvulæ isiciata_;
    Tor. _De Vulvulis et botellis_. See note No. 3.

    [2] V. "_Entrées_" out of respect for the ancients who
    used them as such; today we would class such dishes
    among the "_hors d'œuvres chauds_."

    [3] V. _Vulvula_, dim. for _vulva_, sow's matrix. Cf.
    _vulva_ in dictionary. Possible, also possible that
    _volva_ is meant--a meat roll, a croquette.

    [4] V. Combinations of chopped nuts and pork still in
    vogue today; we use the green pistachios.

    [5] V. The casings which were filled with this forcemeat
    may have been the sow's matrices, also caul. The
    original is vague on the point.


[60] LITTLE SAUSAGE
   _BOTELLUM_ [1]

BOTELLUM IS MADE OF [2] HARD BOILED YOLKS OF EGG [3] CHOPPED PIGNOLIA
NUTS, ONION AND LEEKS, RAW GROUND PINE [4] FINE PEPPER, STUFF IN
CASINGS AND COOK IN BROTH AND WINE [5].

    [1] V. _Botelli_, or _botuli_, are sausage of various
    kind; (French, Boudin, English, Pudding). Originally
    made of raw blood, they are in fact, miniature blood
    sausage. The absence of meat in the present formula
    makes me believe that it is not complete, though hard
    boiled yolk when properly seasoned and mixed with the
    right amount of fat, make a tasty forcemeat for sausage.

    [2] Tor. _Botellum sic fades ex oui_; Sch. and G.-V.
    _sex ovi_--the number of eggs is immaterial.

    [3] Dann. Calf's Sweetbreads.

    [4] Goll. _Thus crudum_--raw blood. _Thus_ or _tus_ is
    either frankincense or the herb, ground-pine. Dann.
    Rosemary. Hum. _Thus crudum lege jus crudum_--jus or
    broth which would make the forcemeat soft. There is no
    reason for changing "_thus_" into "_jus_!"

    [5] G.-V. _Adicies liquamen et vinum, et sic coques_.
    Tor. & _vino decoquas_.



IV


[61] LUCANIAN SAUSAGE
   _LUCANICÆ_

LUCANIAN SAUSAGE [or meat pudding] ARE MADE SIMILAR TO THE ABOVE:
CRUSH PEPPER, CUMIN, SAVORY, RUE, PARSLEY, CONDIMENT, LAUREL BERRIES
AND BROTH; MIX WITH FINELY CHOPPED [fresh Pork] AND POUND WELL WITH
BROTH. TO THIS MIXTURE, BEING RICH, ADD WHOLE PEPPER AND NUTS. WHEN
FILLING CASINGS CAREFULLY PUSH THE MEAT THROUGH. HANG SAUSAGE UP TO
SMOKE.

    V. Lister's interesting remarks about the makers of
    these sausages are given in the dictionary. Cf. Longano.



V


[62] SAUSAGE
   _FARCIMINA_

POUND EGGS AND BRAINS [eggs raw, brains cooked] PINE NUTS [chopped
fine] PEPPER [whole] BROTH AND A LITTLE LASER WITH WHICH FILL THE
CASINGS. FIRST PARBOIL THE SAUSAGE THEN FRY THEM AND SERVE.

    V. The directions are vague enough, but one may
    recognize in them our modern brain sausage.


[63] ANOTHER SAUSAGE
   _ALITER_

WORK COOKED SPELT AND FINELY CHOPPED FRESH PORK TOGETHER, POUND IT
WITH PEPPER, BROTH AND PIGNOLIA NUTS. FILL THE CASINGS, PARBOIL AND
FRY WITH SALT, SERVE WITH MUSTARD, OR YOU MAY CUT THE SAUSAGE IN
SLICES AND SERVE ON A ROUND DISH.


[64] ANOTHER SAUSAGE
   _ALITER_

WASH SPELT AND COOK IT WITH STOCK. CUT THE FAT OF THE INTESTINES OR
BELLY VERY FINE WITH LEEKS. MIX THIS WITH CHOPPED BACON AND FINELY
CHOPPED FRESH PORK. CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE AND THREE EGGS AND MIX ALL IN
THE MORTAR WITH PIGNOLIA NUTS AND WHOLE PEPPER, ADD BROTH, FILL
CASINGS. PARBOIL SAUSAGE, FRY LIGHTLY, OR SERVE THEM BOILED.

    Tor. and Tac. Serve with pheasant gravy. In the early
    editions the following formula which thus ends is
    wanting.


[65] ROUND SAUSAGE
   _CIRELLOS ISICIATOS_

FILL THE CASINGS WITH THE BEST MATERIAL [forcemeat] SHAPE THE SAUSAGE
INTO SMALL CIRCLES, SMOKE. WHEN THEY HAVE TAKEN ON (VERMILLION) COLOR
FRY THEM LIGHTLY. DRESS NICELY GARNISHED ON A PHEASANT WINE GRAVY,
FLAVORED, HOWEVER, WITH CUMIN.

    V. In Tor. and in the earliest edition this formula has
    been contracted with the preceding and made one formula.

[66] VEGETABLES, POT HERBS
   _DE HOLERIBUS_

TO KEEP ALL VEGETABLES GREEN.
  _UT OMNE HOLUS SMARAGDINUM FIAT._

ALL VEGETABLES WILL REMAIN GREEN IF BOILED WITH COOKING SODA [1].

    [1] _Nitrium._ Method still in use today, considered
    injurious to health if copper vessel is used, but the
    amount of copper actually absorbed by the vegetable is
    infinitesimal, imperceptible even by the taste. Copper,
    to be actually harmful would have to be present in such
    quantity as to make enjoyment impossible.



II


[67] VEGETABLE DINNER, EASILY DIGESTED
   _PULMENTARIUM AD VENTREM_ [1]

ALL GREEN VEGETABLES ARE SUITED FOR THIS PURPOSE [2] VERY YOUNG [3]
BEETS AND WELL MATURED LEEKS ARE PARBOILED; ARRANGE THEM IN A BAKING
DISH, GRIND PEPPER AND CUMIN, ADD BROTH AND CONDENSED MUST, OR
ANYTHING ELSE TO SWEETEN THEM A LITTLE, HEAT AND FINISH THEM ON A SLOW
FIRE, AND SERVE.

    [1] V. _Ad ventrem_, "for the belly," simple home
    laxative.

    [2] V. This sentence in Torinus only. Possibly a
    contraction of the foregoing formula, No. 66.

    [3] V. _minutas_, "small," i.e., young.


[68] A SIMILAR DISH
   _SIMILITER_

PARBOIL POLYPODY [1] ROOT SO AS TO SOFTEN THEM, CUT THEM INTO SMALL
PIECES, SEASON WITH GROUND PEPPER AND CUMIN, ARRANGE IN A BAKING DISH,
FINISH ON THE FIRE AND SERVE [2].

    [1] V. Roots of the fern herb.

    [2] V. Although these instructions for vegetable dinners
    are rather vague, they resemble primitive
    _chartreuses_--fancy vegetable dishes developed by the
    Carthusian monks to whom flesh eating was forbidden.
    Elsewhere in Apicius we shall find the _chartreuse_
    developed to a remarkable degree.


[69] ANOTHER LAXATIVE
   _ALITER AD VENTREM_ [1]

SCRUB AND WASH BUNDLES OF BEETS BY RUBBING THEM WITH A LITTLE SODA
[2]. TIE THEM IN INDIVIDUAL BUNDLES, PUT INTO WATER TO BE COOKED, WHEN
DONE, SEASON WITH REDUCED MUST OR RAISIN WINE AND CUMIN, SPRINKLE
WITH PEPPER, ADD A LITTLE OIL, AND WHEN HOT, CRUSH POLYPODY AND NUTS
WITH BROTH, ADD THIS TO THE RED-HOT PAN, INCORPORATING IT WITH THE
BEETS, TAKE OFF THE FIRE QUICKLY AND SERVE.

    [1] This formula wanting in Tor.

    [2] V. Ingenious method to skin tender root vegetables,
    still in vogue today. We remove the skin of tender young
    root vegetables, carrots, beets, etc., by placing them
    in a towel, sprinkling them with rock salt and shaking
    them energetically. The modern power vegetable peeler is
    really built on the same principle, only instead of salt
    (which soon melts) carborundum or rough concrete
    surfaces are used, against which surfaces the vegetables
    are hurled by the rotary motion; often enough, too much
    of the skin is removed, however.


[70] BEETS À LA VARRO
   _BETACEOS VARRONIS_ [1]

VARRO BEETS, THAT IS, BLACK ONES [2] OF WHICH THE ROOTS MUST BE
CLEANED WELL, COOK THEM WITH MEAD AND A LITTLE SALT AND OIL; BOIL THEM
DOWN IN THIS LIQUOR SO THAT THE ROOTS ARE SATURATED THEREBY; THE
LIQUID ITSELF IS GOOD DRINKING. IT IS ALSO NICE TO COOK A CHICKEN IN
WITH THEM.

    [1] G.-V. _Betacios_; Tor. _B. Varrones_. Probably named
    for Varro, the writer on agriculture.

    [2] Roots on the order of parsnips, salsify,
    oysterplant.


[71] ANOTHER LAXATIVE
   _ALITER AD VENTREM_

ANOTHER VEGETABLE DISH, PROMOTING GOOD HEALTH; WASH CELERY, GREENS AND
ROOTS, AND DRY IT IN THE SUN: THEN ALSO COOK THE TENDER PART AND HEAD
OF LEEKS IN A NEW [1] POT, ALLOWING THE WATER TO BOIL DOWN ONE THIRD
OF ITS VOLUME. THEREUPON GRIND PEPPER WITH BROTH AND HONEY IN EQUAL
AMOUNTS PROPERLY MEASURED, MIX IT IN THE MORTAR WITH THE WATER OF THE
COOKED CELERY, STRAIN, BOIL AGAIN AND USE IT TO MASK THE [cooked]
CELERY WITH. IF DESIRED, ADD [the sliced root of the] CELERY TO IT
[2].

    [1] V. "new," i.e., cook leeks in a separate sauce pan;
    NOT together with the celery, which, as the original
    takes for granted, must be cooked also.

    [2] V. We would leave the honey out, make a cream sauce
    from the stock, or, adding bouillon, tie same with a
    little flour and butter, and would call the dish Stewed
    Celery and Leeks. The ancient method is entirely
    rational because the mineral salts of the vegetables are
    preserved and utilized (invariably observed by Apicius)
    which today are often wasted by inexperienced cooks who
    discard these precious elements with the water in which
    vegetables are boiled.



III


[72] ASPARAGUS
   _ASPARAGOS_

ASPARAGUS [Tor. IN ORDER TO HAVE IT MOST AGREEABLE TO THE PALATE] MUST
BE [peeled, washed and] DRIED [1] AND IMMERSED IN BOILING WATER
BACKWARDS [2] [3].

    [1] V. Must be dried before boiling because the cold
    water clinging to the stalks is likely to chill the
    boiling water too much in which the asparagus is to be
    cooked. Apicius here reveals himself as the consummate
    cook who is familiar with the finest detail of physical
    and chemical changes which food undergoes at varying
    temperatures.

    The various editions all agree: _asparagos siccabis_;
    Schuch, however, says: "For the insane _siccabis_ I
    substitute _siciabis_, _isiciabis_, prepare with _sicio_
    [?] and cook." He even goes on to interpret it _cucabis_
    from the Greek _kouki_, cocoanut milk, and infers that
    the asparagus was first cooked in cocoanut milk and then
    put back into water, a method we are tempted to
    pronounce insane.

    [2] V. Backwards! G.-V. _rursum in calidam_; Tac.
    _rursus in aquam calidam_; Tor. _ac rursus ..._

    This word has caused us some reflection, but the ensuing
    discovery made it worth while. _Rursus_ has escaped the
    attention of the other commentators. In this case
    _rursus_ means backwards, being a contraction from
    _revorsum_, h.e. _reversum_. The word is important
    enough to be observed.

    Apicius evidently has the right way of cooking the fine
    asparagus. The stalks, after being peeled and washed
    must be bunched together and tied according to sizes,
    and the bunches must be set into the boiling water
    "backwards," that is, they must stand upright with the
    heads protruding from the water. The heads will be made
    tender above the water line by rising steam and will be
    done simultaneously with the harder parts of the stalks.
    We admit, we have never seen a modern cook observe this
    method. They usually boil the tender heads to death
    while the lower stalks are still hard.

    Though this formula is incomplete (it fails to state the
    sauce to be served, also that the asparagus must be
    peeled and bunched, that the water must contain salt,
    etc.) it is one of the neatest formulæ in Apicius. It is
    amusing to note how the author herein unconsciously
    reveals what a poor litérateur but what a fine cook he
    is. This is characteristic of most good practitioners.
    One may perfectly master the vast subject of cookery,
    yet one may not be able to give a definition of even a
    single term, let alone the ability to exactly describe
    one of the many processes of cookery. Real poets often
    are in the same predicament; none of them ever explained
    the art satisfactorily.

    [3] G.-V. add to the formula _callosiores reddes_--give
    back [eliminate] the harder ones. This sentence belongs
    to the next article. And Torinus, similar to
    Humelbergius, renders this sentence _ut reddas ad gustum
    calliores_--to render the harder ones palatable--the
    squash and pumpkin namely--and we are inclined to agree
    with him.



IV


[73] PUMPKIN, SQUASH
   _CUCURBITAS_

TO HAVE THE HARDER ONES PALATABLE, DO THIS: [1] [Cut the fruit into
pieces, boil and] SQUEEZE THE WATER OUT OF THE BOILED FRUIT AND
ARRANGE [the pieces] IN A BAKING DISH. PUT IN THE MORTAR PEPPER, CUMIN
AND SILPHIUM, THAT IS, A VERY LITTLE OF THE LASER ROOT AND A LITTLE
RUE, SEASON THIS WITH STOCK, MEASURE A LITTLE VINEGAR AND MIX IN A
LITTLE CONDENSED WINE, SO THAT IT CAN BE STRAINED [2] AND POUR THIS
LIQUID OVER THE FRUIT IN THE BAKING DISH; LET IT BOIL THREE TIMES,
RETIRE FROM THE FIRE AND SPRINKLE WITH VERY LITTLE GROUND PEPPER.

    [1] Cf. note 3 to No. 72.

    [2] List. _Ut coloretur_--to give it color; Tor. _ut ius
    coletur_--from _colo_--to strain, to filter.

    Cf. also note 2 to No. 55.


[74] PUMPKIN LIKE DASHEENS
   _ALITER CUCURBITAS IURE COLOCASIORUM_ [1]

BOIL THE PUMPKIN IN WATER LIKE COLOCASIA; GRIND PEPPER, CUMIN AND RUE,
ADD VINEGAR AND MEASURE OUT THE BROTH IN A SAUCEPAN. THE PUMPKIN
PIECES [nicely cut] WATER PRESSED OUT [are arranged] IN A SAUCEPAN
WITH THE BROTH AND ARE FINISHED ON THE FIRE WHILE THE JUICE IS BEING
TIED WITH A LITTLE ROUX. BEFORE SERVING SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER [2].

    [1] V. _Colocasia Antiquorum_ belonging to the dasheen
    or taro family, a valuable tuber, again mentioned in No.
    172, 216, 244 and 322. Cf. various notes, principally
    that to No. 322. Also see U. S. Dept. of Agr. Farmer's
    Bulletin No. 1396, p. 2. This is a "new" and
    commercially and gastronomically important root
    vegetable, the flavor reminding of a combination of
    chestnuts and potatoes, popularly known as "Chinese
    potatoes" which has been recently introduced by the
    U. S. Government from the West Indies where it received
    the name, Dasheen, derived from _de Chine_--from China.

    [2] Tor. continues without interruption into the next
    formula.


[75] PUMPKIN, ALEXANDRINE STYLE
   _ALITER CUCURBITAS MORE ALEXANDRINO_

PRESS THE WATER OUT OF THE BOILED PUMPKIN, PLACE IN A BAKING DISH,
SPRINKLE WITH SALT, GROUND PEPPER, CUMIN, CORIANDER SEED, GREEN MINT
AND A LITTLE LASER ROOT; SEASON WITH VINEGAR. NOW ADD DATE WINE AND
PIGNOLIA NUTS GROUND WITH HONEY, VINEGAR AND BROTH, MEASURE OUT
CONDENSED WINE AND OIL, POUR THIS OVER THE PUMPKIN AND FINISH IN THIS
LIQUOR AND SERVE, SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER BEFORE SERVING.


[76] BOILED PUMPKIN
   _ALITER CUCURBITAS ELIXATAS_

[Boiled Pumpkin] STEWED IN BROTH WITH PURE OIL.


[77] FRIED PUMPKIN
   _ALITER CUCURBITAS FRICTAS_

[Fried pumpkin served with] SIMPLE WINE SAUCE AND PEPPER.


[78] ANOTHER WAY, BOILED AND FRIED
   _ALITER CUCURBITAS ELIXATAS ET FRICTAS_

BOILED PUMPKIN FRIED IS PLACED IN A BAKING PAN. SEASON WITH CUMIN
WINE, ADD A LITTLE OIL; FINISH ON THE FIRE AND SERVE.


[79] ANOTHER WAY, MASHED
   _CUCURBITAS FRICTAS TRITAS_

FRIED [1] PUMPKIN, SEASONED WITH PEPPER, LOVAGE, CUMIN, ORIGANY,
ONION, WINE BROTH AND OIL: STEW THE PUMPKIN [in this] IN A BAKING
DISH, TIE THE LIQUID WITH ROUX [mash] AND SERVE IN THE DISH.

    [1] V. Baking the fruit reduces the water contents,
    renders the purée more substantial. G.-V.
    _Tritas_--mashed. Tor. connects _tritas_ up with pepper,
    hence it is doubtful whether this dish of pumpkin is
    mashed pumpkin.


[80] PUMPKIN AND CHICKEN
   _CUCURBITAS CUM GALLINA_

[Stew the pumpkin with a hen, garnish with] HARD-SKINNED PEACHES,
TRUFFLES; PEPPER, CARRAWAY, AND CUMIN, SILPHIUM AND GREEN HERBS, SUCH
AS MINT, CELERY, CORIANDER, PENNYROYAL, CRESS, WINE [1] OIL AND
VINEGAR.

    [1] Tor. _Vinum vel oleum_; List. _vinum_, _mel_,
    _oleum_.



V


[81] CITRON
   _CITRIUM_ [1]

FOR THE PREPARATION OF CITRON FRUIT WE TAKE SILER [2] FROM THE
MOUNTAINS, SILPHIUM, DRY MINT, VINEGAR AND BROTH.

    [1] List. _Citrini_--a lemon or cucumber squash.

    [2] Tor. _Silerem_; List. _sil_, which is hartwort, a
    kind of cumin or mountain fennel.



VI


[82] CUCUMBERS
   _CUCUMERES_

[Stew the] PEELED CUCUMBERS EITHER IN BROTH [1] OR IN A WINE SAUCE;
[and] YOU WILL FIND THEM TO BE TENDER AND NOT CAUSING INDIGESTION.

    [1] Usually cucumbers are parboiled in water and then
    finished in broth; most often after being parboiled they
    are stuffed with forcemeat and then finished in broth.


[83] CUCUMBERS ANOTHER WAY
   _ALITER CUCUMERES RASOS_

[Peeled cucumbers are] STEWED WITH BOILED BRAINS, CUMIN AND A LITTLE
HONEY. ADD SOME CELERY SEED, STOCK AND OIL, BIND THE GRAVY WITH EGGS
[1] SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.

    [1] Tor. _bis obligabis_--tie twice--for which there is
    no reason, except in case the sauce should curdle. List.
    _oleo elixabis_--fry in oil--obviously wrong, as the
    materials for this stew are already cooked. Sch. _ovis
    obligabis_--bind with eggs--which is the thing to do in
    this case.


[84] ANOTHER CUCUMBER RECIPE
   _ALITER CUCUMERES_

CUCUMBERS, PEPPER, PENNYROYAL, HONEY OR CONDENSED MUST, BROTH AND
VINEGAR; ONCE IN A WHILE ONE ADDS SILPHIUM.

    Sounds like a fancy dressing for raw sliced cucumbers,
    though there are no directions to this effect.



VII


[85] MELON-GOURD AND MELONS
   _PEPONES ET MELONES_

PEPPER, PENNYROYAL, HONEY OR CONDENSED MUST, BROTH AND VINEGAR; ONCE
IN A WHILE ONE ADDS SILPHIUM.

    Same as 84; which confirms above theory. It is quite
    possible that melons were eaten raw with this fancy
    dressing. Many people enjoy melons with pepper and salt,
    or, in salad form with oil and vinegar. Gourds, however,
    to be palatable, must be boiled and served either hot or
    cold with this dressing.



VIII


[86] MALLOWS
   _MALVAS_

THE SMALLER MALLOWS [are prepared] WITH GARUM [1], STOCK [2] OIL AND
VINEGAR; THE LARGER MALLOWS [prepare] WITH A WINE SAUCE, PEPPER AND
STOCK, [adding] CONDENSED WINE OR RAISIN WINE.

    [1] Tor. _Garum_; List. _Oenogarum_.

    [2] _Liquamen_--depending upon the mode of serving the
    mallows, hot or cold.



IX


[87] YOUNG CABBAGE, SPROUTS [1]
   _CYMAS ET CAULICULOS_ [2]

[Boil the] SPROUTS; [1] [season with] CUMIN [3], SALT, WINE AND OIL;
IF YOU LIKE [add] PEPPER, LOVAGE, MINT, RUE, CORIANDER; THE TENDER
LEAVES OF THE STALKS [stew] IN BROTH; WINE AND OIL BE THE SEASONING.

    [1] Including, perhaps, cauliflower and broccoli.

    [2] List. _Cimæ & Coliculi. Nunc crudi cum condimentis
    nunc elixati inferentur._ Served sometimes raw with
    dressing, sometimes boiled.

    [3] Cumin or carraway seed is still used today in the
    preparation of the delicious "Bavarian" cabbage which
    also includes wine and other spices.


[88] ANOTHER WAY
   _ALITER_

CUT THE STALKS IN HALF AND BOIL THEM. THE LEAVES ARE MASHED AND
SEASONED WITH CORIANDER, ONION, CUMIN, PEPPER, RAISIN WINE, OR
CONDENSED WINE AND A LITTLE OIL.

    Very sensible way of using cabbage stalks that are
    usually thrown away. Note the almost scientific
    procedure: the stalks are separated from the leaves,
    split to facilitate cooking; they are cooked separately
    because they require more time than the tender greens.

    Our present method appears barbarous in comparison. We
    quarter the cabbage head, and either boil it or steam
    it. As a result either the tender leaves are cooked to
    death or the stems are still hard. The overcooked parts
    are not palatable, the underdone ones indigestible. Such
    being the case, our boiled cabbage is a complete loss,
    unless prepared the Apician way.


[89] ANOTHER WAY
   _ALITER_

THE COOKED [1] STALKS ARE PLACED IN A [baking] DISH; MOISTEN WITH
STOCK AND PURE OIL, SEASON WITH CUMIN, SPRINKLE [2] WITH PEPPER,
LEEKS, CUMIN, AND GREEN CORIANDER [all] CHOPPED UP.

    [1] Tor. _Coliculi assati_--_sauté_, fried; (Remember:
    _Choux de Bruxelles sauté_) List. _elixati_--boiled.
    G.-V. _Cauliculi elixati_.

    [2] Tor. _Superasperges_; G.-V. _piper asperges_.

    Sounds like a salad of cooked cabbage. The original
    leaves us in doubt as to the temperature of the dish.


[90] ANOTHER WAY
   _ALITER_

THE VEGETABLE, SEASONED AND PREPARED IN THE ABOVE WAY IS STEWED WITH
PARBOILED LEEKS.


[91] ANOTHER WAY
   _ALITER_

TO THE SPROUTS OR STALKS, SEASONED AND PREPARED AS ABOVE, ARE ADDED
GREEN OLIVES WHICH ARE HEATED LIKEWISE.


[92] ANOTHER WAY
   _ALITER_

PREPARE THE SPROUTS IN THE ABOVE WAY, COVER THEM WITH BOILED SPELT AND
PINE NUTS [1] AND SPRINKLE [2] WITH RAISINS.

    [1] The nuts should not astonish us. The French today
    have a delicious dish, _Choux de Bruxelles aux
    Marrons_--Brussels Sprouts with Chestnuts. Sprouts and
    chestnuts are, of course, cooked separately; the lightly
    boiled sprouts are _sauté_ in butter; the chestnuts
    parboiled, peeled, and finished in stock with a little
    sugar or syrup, tossed in butter and served in the
    center of the sprouts.

    The Apician formula with cereal and raisins added is too
    exotic to suit our modern taste, but without a question
    is a nutritious dish and complete from a dietetic point
    of view.

    [2] Tor. _Superasperges_; G.-V. _piper asperges_.



X


[93] LEEKS
   _PORROS_

WELL MATURED LEEKS [1] ARE BOILED WITH A PINCH OF SALT [2] IN
[combined] WATER AND OIL [3]. THEY ARE THEN STEWED IN OIL AND IN THE
BEST KIND OF BROTH, AND SERVED.

    [1] Tor. _Poros bene maturos_; G.-V. _maturos fieri_.

    [2] One of the rare instances where Apicius mentions
    salt in cookery, i.e., salt in a dry form. _Pugnum
    salis_--a fist of salt--he prescribes here. Usually it
    is _liquamen_--broth, brine--he uses.

    [3] Tor. is correct in finishing the sentence here.
    G.-V. continue _et eximes._, which is the opening of the
    next sentence, and it makes a difference in the formula.


[94] ANOTHER WAY TO COOK LEEKS
   _ALITER PORROS_

WRAP THE LEEKS WELL IN CABBAGE LEAVES, HAVING FIRST COOKED THEM AS
DIRECTED ABOVE [1] AND THEN FINISH THEM IN THE ABOVE WAY.

    [1] Tor. _in primis_--first; List., G.-V. _in
    prunis_--hot embers.


[95] ANOTHER WAY
   _ALITER PORROS_

COOK THE LEEKS WITH [laurel] BERRIES [1], [and otherwise treat them]
AND SERVE AS ABOVE.

    [1] Tor. _Porros in bacca coctos_; List. _in
    cacabo_--cooked in a casserole; Sch. _bafa
    embama_--steeped, marinated (in oil); G.-V. _in baca
    coctos_. Another way to read this: _baca et fabæ_--with
    beans--is quite within reason. The following formula,
    96, is perhaps only a variant of the above.

    Brandt: with olives, referring to No. 91 as a precedent.


[96] LEEKS AND BEANS
   _ALITER PORROS_

AFTER HAVING BOILED THE LEEKS IN WATER, [green string] BEANS WHICH
HAVE NOT YET BEEN PREPARED OTHERWISE, MAY BE BOILED [in the leek
water] [1] PRINCIPALLY ON ACCOUNT OF THE GOOD TASTE THEY WILL ACQUIRE;
AND MAY THEN BE SERVED WITH THE LEEKS.

    [1] Apicius needed no modern science of nutrition to
    remind him of the value of the mineral salts in
    vegetables.



XI


[97] BEETS
   _BETAS_

TO MAKE A DISH OF BEETS THAT WILL APPEAL TO YOUR TASTE [1] SLICE [the
beets, [2] with] LEEKS AND CRUSH CORIANDER AND CUMIN; ADD RAISIN WINE
[3], BOIL ALL DOWN TO PERFECTION: BIND IT, SERVE [the beets] SEPARATE
FROM THE BROTH, WITH OIL AND VINEGAR.

    [1] Sentence in Tor.; wanting in List. _et al._

    [2] List. No mention of beets is made in this formula;
    therefore, it may belong to the foregoing leek recipes.
    V. This is not so. Here the noun is made subject to the
    first verb, as is practiced frequently. Moreover, the
    mode of preparation fits beets nicely, except for the
    flour to which we object in note 3, below. To cook beets
    with leeks, spices and wine and serve them (cold) with
    oil and vinegar is indeed a method that cannot be
    improved upon.

    [3] Tac., Tor., List., G.-V. _uvam passam_,
    _Farinam_--raisins and flour--for which there is no
    reason. Sch. _varianam_--raisin wine of the Varianian
    variety; Bas. _Phariam_. V. inclined to agree with Sch.
    and Bas.


[98] ANOTHER WAY
   _ALITER BETAS ELIXAS_

COOK THE BEETS WITH MUSTARD [seed] AND SERVE THEM WELL PICKLED IN A
LITTLE OIL AND VINEGAR.

    V. Add bay leaves, cloves, pepper grains, sliced onion
    and a little sugar, and you have our modern pickled
    beets.



XII


[99] GREEN VEGETABLES, POT HERBS
   _OLISERA_ [1]

[The greens] TIED IN HANDY BUNDLES, COOKED AND SERVED WITH PURE OIL;
ALSO PROPER WITH FRIED FISH.

    [1] Tac. _Olisera_; Tor. _Olifera_ (_sev mauis olyra_)
    Tor. is mistaken. Hum., List. _Olisatra_; (old Ms. note
    in our Hum. copy: "_Alessandrina uulgò_") from
    _olusatrum_--_olus_--pot herbs, cabbage, turnips. G.-V.
    _Holisera_, from _holus_, i.e. _olus_ and from _olitor_
    one who raises pot herbs.



XIII


[100] TURNIPS OR NAVEWS
    _RAPAS SIVE NAPOS_

[Turnips are] COOKED [soft, the water is] SQUEEZED [out; then] CRUSH A
GOOD AMOUNT OF CUMIN AND A LITTLE RUE, ADD PARTHICAN [1] LASER OR [2]
VINEGAR, STOCK, CONDENSED WINE AND OIL [3] HEAT MODERATELY AND SERVE.

    [1] i.e. Persian laser; List. _laser, Parthicum_; (the
    comma makes a difference!) Sch. _particum_--a part.

    [2] Tac., Tor. _vel acetum_; List. G.-V. _mel, acetum_.
    Another comma; and "honey" instead of "or." V. We doubt
    this: the vinegar is an alternative, for it takes the
    place of the more expensive Persian _laser_ (which was
    an essence of the _laser_ root, often diluted with
    vinegar).

    [3] List., G.-V. _oleum modice_: _fervere_; Tor. _&
    oleum, quæ modice fervere facias_. Again note Lister's
    punctuation here and in the foregoing notes. The
    misplaced commas and colons raise havoc with the formulæ
    everywhere. Torinus, who in his preface complains that
    his authority has no punctuation whatsoever and thereby
    indicates that it must have been a very ancient copy,
    (at least prior to the 1503 Tac. ed.) is generally not
    far from the mark. It is also doubtful that the variants
    are by him, as is claimed by List. In this instance,
    indeed, Tor. is again correct.


[101] ANOTHER WAY [1]
    _ALITER RAPAS SIVE NAPOS_

[The turnips are] BOILED, SERVED DRESSED WITH OIL, TO WHICH, IF
DESIRED, YOU MAY ADD VINEGAR [2].

    [1] Tor. _ad delitias_--delightful.

    [2] V. Presumably served cold, as a salad; cf. No. 122.



XIV


[102] RADISHES
    _RAPHANOS_

PEPPER THE RADISHES WELL; OR, EQUALLY WELL: GRATE IT WITH PEPPER AND
BRINE.

    Sch., G.-V. _Rafanos_; _Raphanos agria_,--a kind of
    horseradish; Plinius: h.e. _raphanus sylvestris_.



XV


[103] SOFT CABBAGE
    _OLUS MOLLE_

THE CABBAGE IS COOKED WITH POT HERBS IN SODA WATER; PRESS [the water
out] CHOP IT VERY FINE: [now] CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, DRY SATURY WITH
DRY ONIONS, ADD STOCK, OIL AND WINE.


[104] ANOTHER MASHED GREEN VEGETABLE
    _ALTER OLUS MOLLE_ [_EX APIO_]

COOK CELERY IN SODA WATER, SQUEEZE [water out] CHOP FINE. IN THE
MORTAR CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, ORIGANY, ONION [and mix with] WINE AND
STOCK, ADDING SOME OIL. COOK THIS IN THE BOILER [1] AND MIX THE
CELERY WITH THIS PREPARATION.

    [1] _in pultario_. The _pultarius_ is a pot in which
    cereals were boiled; from _puls_--porridge, pap.


[105] ANOTHER MASHED VEGETABLE
    _ALITER OLUS MOLLE_ [_EX LACTUCIS_]

COOK THE LETTUCE LEAVES WITH ONION IN SODA WATER, SQUEEZE [the water
out] CHOP VERY FINE; IN THE MORTAR CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, CELERY SEED,
DRY MINT, ONION; ADD STOCK, OIL AND WINE.


[106] TO PREVENT MASHED VEGETABLES FROM TURNING
    _OLUS MOLLE NE ARESCAT_ [1]

IT WILL BE REQUIRED ABOVE ALL TO CLEAN THE VEGETABLES WELL, TO CUT OFF
ALL DECAYED PARTS AND TO COVER [the cooked vegetables] WITH WORMWOOD
WATER.

    [1] Tor. _ne ... exarescat_, the difference in the
    meaning is immaterial.



XVI


[107] FIELD HERBS
    _HERBÆ RUSTICÆ_

FIELD AND FOREST [1] HERBS ARE PREPARED [2] [either raw] WITH STOCK
[3] OIL AND VINEGAR [as a salad, [4]] OR AS A COOKED DISH [5] BY
ADDING PEPPER, CUMIN AND MASTICH BERRIES.

    [1] Tor. _ac sylvestres_; V. German, _Feldsalat_.

    [2] Tor. _parantur_; wanting in other editions.

    [3] _Liquamine_, here interpreted as brine.

    [4] Tac., Sch., _et al._ _a manu_; Tor. _vel
    manu_--because eaten with the hand.

    [5] Tor. _vel in patina_.



XVII


[108] NETTLES
    _URTICÆ_

THE FEMALE NETTLES, WHEN THE SUN IS IN THE POSITION OF THE ARIES, IS
SUPPOSED TO RENDER VALUABLE SERVICES AGAINST AILMENTS OF VARIOUS KINDS
[1].

    [1] Tac., List., Sch., _et al._ _adversus ægritudinem_.

    Barthius: _Quam ægritudinem?_ etc., etc.

    Tor. _plurifarias_!

    Reinsenius: _ad arcendum morbum_, etc., etc.

    Hum. _scilicet quamcunque hoc est ..._ etc., etc., etc.

    G.-V. _si voles_.

    V. This innocent little superstition about the curative
    qualities of the female nettle causes the savants to
    engage in various speculations.

    Nettles are occasionally eaten as vegetables on the
    Continent.



XVIII


[109] ENDIVES AND LETTUCE
    _INTUBA ET LACTUCÆ_

ENDIVES [are dressed] WITH BRINE, A LITTLE OIL AND CHOPPED ONION,
INSTEAD OF THE REAL LETTUCE [1] IN WINTER TIME THE ENDIVES ARE TAKEN
OUT OF THE PICKLE [2] [and are dressed] WITH HONEY OR VINEGAR.

    [1] Hum. _pro lactucis uere_; Tor. _p. l. accipint_;
    G.-V. _p. l. vero_ (separated by period)--all indicating
    that endives are a substitute for lettuce when this is
    not available.

    [2] Cf. ℞ No. 27, also Nos. 22 and 23.


[110] LETTUCE SALAD, FIELD SALAD
    _AGRESTES LACTUCÆ_ [1]

[Dress it] WITH VINEGAR DRESSING AND A LITTLE BRINE STOCK; WHICH HELPS
DIGESTION AND IS TAKEN TO COUNTERACT INFLATION [2].

    [1] Tor. _sic_; Hum. _agri l._; Tac. _id._; Sch. and
    G.-V. have _acri_ as an adjective to vinegar, the last
    word in the preceding formula.

    [2] List. and Hum. continuing: "And this salad will not
    hurt you"; but Tor., Sch. and G.-V. use this as a
    heading for the following formula.


[111] A HARMLESS SALAD
    _NE LACTUCÆ LÆDANT_

[And in order that the lettuce may not hurt you take (with it or after
it) the following preparation] [1] 2 OUNCES OF GINGER, 1 OUNCE OF
GREEN RUE, 1 OUNCE OF MEATY DATES, 12 SCRUPLES OF GROUND PEPPER, 1
OUNCE OF GOOD HONEY, AND 8 OUNCES OF EITHER ÆTHIOPIAN OR SYRIAN CUMIN.
MAKE AN INFUSION OF THIS IN VINEGAR, THE CUMIN CRUSHED, AND STRAIN. OF
THIS LIQUOR USE A SMALL SPOONFUL MIX IT WITH STOCK AND A LITTLE
VINEGAR: YOU MAY TAKE A SMALL SPOONFUL AFTER THE MEAL [2].

    [1] Tac. and Tor. _Ne lactucæ lædant_ [take it] _cum
    zingiberis uncijs duabus_, etc. Hum., List., G.-V.
    _cumini unc. II._ They and Sch. read the _cum_ of Tac.
    and Tor. for _cumini_, overlooking the fact that the
    recipe later calls for Aethopian or Syrian cumin as
    well. This shifts the weights of the various ingredients
    from the one to the other, completely upsetting the
    sense of the formula.

    [2] Goll. ignores this passage completely.

    V. This is another of the medical formulæ that have
    suffered much by experimentation and interpretation
    through the ages. It seems to be an aromatic vinegar for
    a salad dressing, and, as such, a very interesting
    article, reminding of our present tarragon, etc.,
    vinegars. To be used judiciously in salads.

    Again, as might be expected, the medicinal character of
    the formula inspires the medieval doctors to profound
    meditation and lively debate.

    Cf. ℞ Nos. 34 and 108.



XIX


[112] CARDOONS
    _CARDUI_

CARDOONS [are eaten with a dressing of] BRINY BROTH, OIL, AND CHOPPED
[hard] EGGS.

    V. Precisely as we do today: French dressing and hard
    boiled eggs. We do not forget pepper, of course. Perhaps
    the ancient "briny broth" contained enough of this and
    of other ingredients, such as fine condiments and spices
    to make the dressing perfect.


[113] ANOTHER [Dressing for] CARDOONS
    _ALITER CARDUOS_

RUE, MINT, CORIANDER, FENNEL--ALL GREEN--FINELY CRUSHED; ADD PEPPER,
LOVAGE, AND [1] BRINE AND OIL [2].

    [1] Tac. and Tor. _vel._; List., Sch., G.-V.
    _mel_--honey--which would spoil this fine _vinaigrette_
    or cold _fines herbes dressing_. However, even nowadays,
    sugar is quite frequently added to salad dressings.

    [2] Gollmer claims that this dressing is served with
    cooked cardoons, the recipe for which follows below.
    This is wanting in Tor.


[114] BOILED CARDOONS
    _ALITER CARDUOS ELIXOS_

[Are served with] PEPPER, CUMIN, BROTH AND OIL.



XX


[115] (COW-) PARSNIPS [?]
    _SPONDYLI VEL FONDULI_ [1]

COW-PARSNIPS ARE FRIED [and eaten] WITH A SIMPLE WINE SAUCE.

    [1] Tac. _Spondili uel fonduli_ and _Sphon ..._; Tor. as
    above; Hum. _Spongioli uel funguli_; List., _id._; Sch.
    _Sfondili uel funguli_; G.-V. _Sphondyli uel funduli_.

    Cf. note to Nos. 46, 121, 122.


[116] ANOTHER WAY
    _ALITER_

BOIL THE PARSNIPS IN SALT WATER [and season them] WITH PURE OIL [1],
CHOPPED GREEN CORIANDER AND WHOLE PEPPER.

    [1] Tac. _Oleo mero_; Other editors: _Oleo, mero_. V.
    The comma is misplaced.


[117] ANOTHER WAY
    _ALITER_

PREPARE THE BOILED PARSNIPS WITH THE FOLLOWING SAUCE: CELERY SEED,
RUE, HONEY, GROUND PEPPER, MIXED WITH RAISIN WINE, STOCK AND A LITTLE
OIL; BIND THIS WITH ROUX [bring to a boiling point, immerse parsnips]
SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.


[118] ANOTHER WAY [Purée of Parsnips] [1]
    _ALITER_

MASH THE PARSNIPS, [add] CUMIN, RUE, STOCK, A LITTLE CONDENSED
WINE, OIL, GREEN CORIANDER [and] LEEKS AND SERVE; GOES WELL WITH
SALT PORK [2].

    [1] Again faulty punctuation obscures the text.
    Carefully compare the following: Tac. and Tor.
    _Spondylos teres, cuminum_, etc. Hum., List. and G.-V.
    _S. teres cuminum_, i.e. crush the cumin. Sch. _S.
    tores_--dry, parch!

    [2] _Inferes pro salso_--serve with salt pork or bacon,
    or, instead of--_Salsum_--salt pork. Dann. Well seasoned
    with salt! Sch. _infares pro salsa_. For further
    confirmation of _salsum_ cf. ℞ Nos. 148-152.


[119] ANOTHER WAY
    _ALITER_

BOIL THE PARSNIPS [sufficiently, if] HARD [1] [then] PUT THEM IN A
SAUCE PAN AND STEW WITH OIL, STOCK, PEPPER, RAISIN WINE, STRAIN [2]
AND BIND WITH ROUX.

    [1] Tor. _præduratos_; List. _prædurabis_. How can they
    be hardened? It may perhaps stand for "parboil." We
    agree with Tor. that the hard ones (_præduratos_) must
    be cooked soft.

    [2] Tor. and Tac. _Colabis_--strain; List. and G.-V.
    _Colorabis_--color. No necessity for coloring the gravy,
    but straining after the binding with roux is important
    which proves Tor. correct again. Cf. note 1 to ℞ No.
    73 and note 2 to ℞ No. 55.


[120] ANOTHER WAY
    _ALITER_ [1]

FINISH [marinate] THE PARSNIPS IN OIL AND BROTH, OR FRY THEM IN OIL,
SPRINKLE WITH SALT AND PEPPER, AND SERVE.

    [1] Ex G.-V. wanting in Tor. and List. Found in Sch.
    also. V. Procedure quite in accordance with modern
    practice. We envelope the p. in flour or frying batter.


[121] ANOTHER WAY
    _ALITER_ [1]

BRUISE THE BOILED PARSNIPS [scallops, muscular part of shellfish]
ELIMINATE THE HARD STRINGS; ADD BOILED SPELT AND CHOPPED HARD EGGS,
STOCK AND PEPPER. MAKE CROQUETTES OR SAUSAGE FROM THIS, ADDING
PIGNOLIA NUT AND PEPPER, WRAP IN CAUL [or fill in casings] FRY AND
SERVE THEM AS AN ENTRÉE DISH IN A WINE SAUCE.

    [1] V. This formula is virtually a repetition of ℞ No.
    46, all the more bewildering because of the divergence
    of the term (Cf. ℞ No. 115), which stands for
    "scallops" or the muscular part of any bivalve, at least
    in the above formula.

    The Græco-Latin word for cow-parsnip is _spondylium_,
    _sphondylium_, _spondylion_. It is almost certain that
    the preceding parsnips formulæ are in the right place
    here. They are in direct line with the other vegetables
    here treated--the shellfish--_spondylus_--would be out
    of place in this chapter, Book III, The Gardener. All
    the recipes, with the exception of the above, fit a
    vegetable like parsnips. Even Lister's and Humelberg's
    interpretation of the term, who read
    _spongioli_--mushrooms--could be questioned under this
    heading, Book III.

    It is barely possible that this entire series of
    formulæ, _Spondyli uel fonduli_ (℞ Nos. 115-121) does
    belong to Book II among the scallop _hysitia_, though we
    are little inclined to accept this theory.

    Cf. ℞ No. 122 which appears to be a confirmation of
    the view expressed above.



XXI


[122] CARROTS AND PARSNIPS
    _CAROTÆ ET PASTINACÆ_

CARROTS OR PARSNIPS ARE FRIED [and served] WITH A WINE SAUCE.

    V. Exactly like ℞ No. 115, which may be a
    confirmation that _spondyli_ stands for cow-parsnips.


[123] ANOTHER WAY
    _ALITER_

THE CARROTS [are cooked] SALTED [and served] WITH PURE OIL AND
VINEGAR.

    V. As a salad. "Italian Salad" consists of a variety of
    such cooked vegetables, nicely dressed with oil and
    vinegar, or with mayonnaise. Cf. ℞ No. 102.


[124] ANOTHER WAY
    _ALITER_

THE CARROTS [are] BOILED [and] SLICED, STEWED WITH CUMIN AND A LITTLE
OIL AND ARE SERVED. AT THE SAME TIME [1] [here is your opportunity]
MAKE A CUMIN SAUCE [from the carrot juice] FOR THOSE WHO HAVE THE
COLIC [2].

    [1] Ex Tor. wanting elsewhere.

    [2] Tac. _coliorum_; Tor. _cuminatum colicorum_; List.

[125] BOILED DINNER
    _SALACATTABIA_ [2]

PEPPER, FRESH MINT, CELERY, DRY PENNYROYAL, CHEESE [3], PIGNOLIA NUTS,
HONEY, VINEGAR, BROTH, YOLKS OF EGG, FRESH WATER, SOAKED BREAD AND THE
LIQUID PRESSED OUT, COW'S CHEESE AND CUCUMBERS ARE ARRANGED IN A DISH,
ALTERNATELY, WITH THE NUTS; [also add] FINELY CHOPPED CAPERS [4],
CHICKEN LIVERS [5]; COVER COMPLETELY WITH [a lukewarm, congealing]
BROTH, PLACE ON ICE [and when congealed unmould and] SERVE UP [6].

    [1] Read: _Pandectes_--embracing the whole science.

    [2] Read: _Salacaccabia_--from _salsa_ and
    _caccabus_--salt meat boiled in the pot. Sch. _Sala

    [6] This dish if pork were added (cf. Sch. in note 4
    above) would resemble our modern "headcheese"; the
    presence of cheese in this formula and in our word
    "headcheese" is perhaps not accidental; the cheese has
    been eliminated in the course of time from dishes of
    this sort while the name has remained with us. "Cheese"
    also appears in the German equivalent for
    custard--_Eierkäse_.


[126] APICIAN JELLY
    _SALACATTABIA APICIANA_

PUT IN THE MORTAR CELERY SEED, DRY PENNYROYAL, DRY MINT, GINGER, FRESH
CORIANDER, SEEDLESS RAISINS, HONEY, VINEGAR, OIL AND WINE; CRUSH IT
TOGETHER [in order to make a dressing of it]. [Now] PLACE 3 PIECES OF
PICENTIAN BREAD IN A MOULD, INTERLINED WITH PIECES OF [cooked]
CHICKEN, [cooked] SWEETBREADS OF CALF OR LAMB, CHEESE [1], PIGNOLIA
NUTS, CUCUMBERS [pickles] FINELY CHOPPED DRY ONIONS [shallots]
COVERING THE WHOLE WITH [jellified] BROTH. BURY THE MOULD IN SNOW UP
TO THE RIM; [unmould] SPRINKLE [with the above dressing] AND SERVE
[2].

    [1] List. _caseum Vestinum_--a certain cheese from the
    Adriatic coast.

    [2] The nature of the first passage of this formula
    indicates a dressing for a cold dish. The dish was
    probably unmoulded when firm, and the jelly covered with
    this dressing, though the original does not state this
    procedure. In that case it would resemble a highly
    complicated chicken salad, such as we make
    today--_mayonnaise de volaille en aspic_, for instance.
    We recall the artistic molds for puddings and other
    dishes which the ancients had which were nicely suited
    for dishes such as the above.

    The Picentian bread--made of spelt--was a celebrated
    product of the bakeries of Picentia, a town of lower
    Italy, near the Tuscan sea, according to Pliny.

    Today it remains as a dressing for roast fowl, etc.
    Quoting from "A Collection of Receipts in Cookery,
    Physick and Surgery," London, 1724:

    "Panada for a Sick or Weak Stomach. Put the crumbs of a
    Penny White-Loaf grated into a Quart of cold Water, set
    both on the Fire together with a blade of Mace: When
    'tis boil'd smooth, take it off the fire and put in a
    bit of Lemon-peel, the juice of a Lemon, a glass of Sack
    [Spanish Wine] and Sugar to your Taste. This is very
    Nourishing and never offends the Stomach. Some season
    with butter and Sugar, adding Currants which on some
    occasions are proper; but the first is the most grateful
    and innocent."

    Mrs. Glasse, a quarter century later, in her famous book
    [The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy, London, 1747,
    1st ed.] omits the wine, but Mrs. Mason, at about the
    same time, insists on having it with panada.

    The imaginary or real relation between the sciences of
    cookery and medicine is illustrated here.

[129] ANOTHER DISH, WHICH CAN BE TURNED OVER [A Nut Custard]
    _ALITER PATINA VERSATILIS_

THE DISH, CALLED TURN-OVER, IS THUS MADE [1] CRUSH VERY FINE WALNUTS
AND HAZELNUTS [2] TOAST THEM AND CRUSH WITH HONEY, MIX IN PEPPER,
BROTH, MILK AND EGGS AND A LITTLE OIL [3].

    [1] Tor.

    [2] List. _torres eas_--toast them (wanting in Tor.)
    which is the thing to do. Cf. No. 143, practically a
    repetition of this. Cf. 301.

    [3] This laconic formula indicates a custard poached,
    like in the preceding, in a mould, which, when cooled
    off, is unmoulded in the usual way. This _patina
    versatilis_ is in fact the modern _crême renversée_,
    with nuts.

    It is characteristic of Apicius for incompleteness and
    want of precise directions, without which the experiment
    in the hands of an inexperienced operator would result
    in failure.


[130] ANOTHER
    _ALITER PATINA_

ANOTHER DISH IS MADE OF THE [1] STRUNKS OF LETTUCE CRUSHED WITH

TAKE VEGETABLES, CLEAN AND WASH, SHRED [2] AND COOK THEM [3] COOL THEM
OFF AND DRAIN THEM. TAKE 4 [calf's] BRAINS, REMOVE [the skin and]
STRINGS AND COOK THEM [4] IN THE MORTAR PUT 6 SCRUPLES OF PEPPER,
MOISTEN WITH BROTH AND CRUSH FINE; THEN ADD THE BRAINS, RUB AGAIN AND
MEANWHILE ADD THE VEGETABLES, RUBBING ALL THE WHILE, AND MAKE A FINE
PASTE OF IT. THEREUPON BREAK AND ADD 8 EGGS. NOW ADD A GLASSFUL [5] OF
BROTH, A GLASSFUL OF WINE, A GLASSFUL OF RAISIN WINE, TASTE THIS
PREPARATION. OIL THE BAKING DISH THOROUGHLY [put the mixture in the
dish] AND PLACE IT IN THE HOT PLATE, (THAT IS ABOVE THE HOT ASHES) [6]
AND WHEN IT IS DONE [unmould it] SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE [7].

    [1] List. _frictilis_; Vat. Ms. _fusilis_; G.-V. _id._;
    Lan. _frisilis_.

    _Patina frisilis_ remains unexplained. None of the
    various readings can be satisfactorily rendered. If the
    vegetables had remained whole the dish might be compared
    to a _chartreuse_, those delightful creations by the
    Carthusian monks who compelled by the strictest rules of
    vegetarianism evolved a number of fine vegetable dishes.
    On the other hand, the poached mixture of eggs and
    brains is akin to our _farces_ and _quenelles_; but in
    modern cookery we have nothing just like this _patina
    frisilis_.

COLD ASPARAGUS PIE IS MADE IN THIS MANNER [1] TAKE WELL CLEANED
[cooked] ASPARAGUS, CRUSH IT IN THE MORTAR, DILUTE WITH WATER AND
PRESENTLY STRAIN IT THROUGH THE COLANDER. NOW TRIM, PREPARE [i.e. cook

[134] A DISH OF FIELD VEGETABLES
    _PATINA EX RUSTICIS_ [1]

BY FOLLOWING THE ABOVE INSTRUCTIONS YOU MAY MAKE [2] A PIE OF FIELD
VEGETABLES, OR OF THYME [3] OR OF GREEN PEPPERS [4] OR OF CUCUMBERS OR
OF SMALL TENDER SPROUTS [5] SAME AS ABOVE, OR, IF YOU LIKE, MAKE ONE

    is hardly likely to be the chief ingredient of such a
    dish; the chances are it was used for flavoring and that
    the above enumerated vegetables were combined in one
    dish.

    _PATINA DE SAMBUCO_ [1]

A DISH OF ELDERBERRIES, EITHER HOT OR COLD, IS MADE IN THIS MANNER [2]
TAKE ELDERBERRIES [3] WASH THEM; COOK IN WATER, SKIM AND STRAIN.
PREPARE A DISH IN WHICH TO COOK THE CUSTARD [4] CRUSH 6 SCRUPLES OF
PEPPER WITH A LITTLE BROTH; ADD THIS TO THE ELDERBERRY PULP WITH
ANOTHER GLASS OF BROTH, A GLASS OF WINE, A GLASS OF RAISIN WINE AND AS
MUCH AS 4 OUNCES OF OIL. PUT THE DISH IN THE HOT BATH AND STIR THE
CONTENTS. AS SOON AS IT IS GETTING WARM, QUICKLY BREAK 6 EGGS AND
WHIPPING THEM, INCORPORATE THEM, IN ORDER TO THICKEN THE FLUID. WHEN
THICK ENOUGH SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE UP.

[136] ROSE PIE, ROSE CUSTARD OR PUDDING
    _PATINA DE ROSIS_

TAKE ROSES FRESH FROM THE FLOWER BED, STRIP OFF THE LEAVES, REMOVE THE
WHITE [from the petals and] PUT THEM IN THE MORTAR; POUR OVER SOME
BROTH [and] RUB FINE. ADD A GLASS OF BROTH AND STRAIN THE JUICE
THROUGH THE COLANDER. [This done] TAKE 4 [cooked calf's] BRAINS, SKIN
THEM AND REMOVE THE NERVES; CRUSH 8 SCRUPLES OF PEPPER MOISTENED WITH
THE JUICE AND RUB [with the brains]; THEREUPON BREAK 8 EGGS, ADD 1 [1]
GLASS OF WINE, 1 GLASS OF RAISIN WINE AND A LITTLE OIL. MEANWHILE
GREASE A PAN, PLACE IT ON THE HOT ASHES [or in the hot bath] IN WHICH
POUR THE ABOVE DESCRIBED MATERIAL; WHEN THE MIXTURE IS COOKED IN THE
_BAIN MARIS_ [2] SPRINKLE IT WITH PULVERIZED PEPPER AND SERVE [3].

    [1] List., G.-V. 1-1/2 glass.

    [2] Hot water bath.

    [3] Tor. continues ℞ No. 135 without interruption or
    caption, and describes the above recipe. He reads: _De
    thoris accipies rosas_, but List. insists that _de
    thoris_ be read _de rosis_; Lan., Tac. _de toris_; V.
    _de thoris_ may be read "fresh from the flower bed."

    Cf. ℞ Nos. 167 and 171 in which case the "rose" may
    stand for rosy apple, or "Roman Beauty" apple. "Rose
    apple" also is a small pimento, size of a plum.


[137] PUMPKIN PIE
    _PATINA DE CUCURBITIS_ [1]

AND PUMPKIN PIE IS MADE THUS [2] STEWED AND MASHED PUMPKIN IS PLACED
IN THE PAN [or pie dish] SEASONED WITH A LITTLE CUMIN ESSENCE. ADD A
LITTLE OIL; HEAT [bake] AND SERVE [3].

    [1] Dann. Cucumber Dish.

    [2] Tor. Wanting in other texts.

    [3] Modern English recipes for stewed pumpkin resemble
    this Apician precept, but America has made a really
    palatable dish from pumpkin by the addition of eggs,
    cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger--spices which the insipid
    pumpkin needs. The ancient original may have omitted the
    eggs because Apicius probably expected his formula to be
    carried out in accordance with the preceding formulæ.
    Perhaps this is proven by the fact that Tor. continues
    the Rose Pie recipe with _et cucurbita patina sic fiet_.


[138] SPRATS OR SMELTS AU VIN BLANC
    _PATINA DE APUA_ [1]

CLEAN THE SMELTS [or other small fish, filets of sole, etc. of white
meat] MARINATE [i.e. impregnate with] IN OIL, PLACE IN A SHALLOW PAN,
ADD OIL, BROTH [2] AND WINE. BUNCH [3] [fresh] RUE AND MARJORAM AND
COOK WITH THE FISH. WHEN DONE REMOVE THE HERBS, SEASON THE FISH WITH
PEPPER AND SERVE [4].

    [1] Ex List. and G.-V. wanting in Tor.

    [2] _Liquamen_, which in this case corresponds to _court
    bouillon_, a broth prepared from the trimmings of the
    fish, herbs, and wine, well-seasoned and reduced.

    [3] Our very own _bouquet garni_, a bunch of various
    aromatic herbs, inserted during coction and retired
    before serving.

    [4] Excellent formula for fish in white wine, resembling
    our ways of making this fine dish.

    This again illustrates the laconic style of the ancient
    author. He omitted to say that the fish, when cooked,
    was placed on the service platter and that the juices
    remaining in the sauce pan were tied with one or two egg
    yolks, diluted with cream, or wine, or _court bouillon_,
    strained and poured over the fish at the moment of
    serving. This is perhaps the best method of preparing
    fish with white meat of a fine texture. Pink or darker
    fish do not lend themselves to this method of
    preparation.


[139] SMELT PIE, OR, SPRAT CUSTARD
    _PATINA DE ABUA SIVE APUA_ [1]

BONELESS PIECES OF ANCHOVIES OR [other small] FISH, EITHER ROAST
[fried] BOILED, CHOP VERY FINE. FILL A CASSEROLE GENEROUSLY WITH THE
SAME [season with] CRUSHED PEPPER AND A LITTLE RUE, ADD SUFFICIENT
BROTH AND SOME OIL, AND MIX IN, ALSO ADD ENOUGH RAW EGGS SO THAT THE
WHOLE FORMS ONE SOLID MASS. NOW CAREFULLY ADD SOME SEA-NETTLES BUT
TAKE PAIN THAT THEY ARE NOT MIXED WITH THE EGGS. NOW PUT THE DISH INTO
THE STEAM SO THAT IT MAY CONGEAL [but avoid boiling] [2]. WHEN DONE
SPRINKLE WITH GROUND PEPPER AND CARRY INTO THE DINING ROOM. NOBODY
WILL BE ABLE TO TELL WHAT HE IS ENJOYING [3].

    [1] Tac., Tor. _sic_. List., G.-V. _p. de apua sine
    apua_--a dish of anchovies (or smelts) without
    anchovies. Tor. formula bears the title _patina de
    apua_, and his article opens with the following
    sentence: _patin de abua sive apua sic facies_. He is
    therefore quite emphatic that the dish is to be made
    with the _abua_ or _apua_ (an anchovy) and not without
    _apua_, as List. has it. Lan. calls the dish: P. _de
    apabadiade_, not identified.

    [2] Tor. _impones ad uaporem ut cum ouis meare
    possint_--warning, get along with the eggs, i.e. beware
    of boiling them for they will curdle, and the experiment
    is hopelessly lost. List. however, reads _meare possint_
    thus: _bullire p._--boil (!) It is quite plain that Tor.
    has the correct formula.

    [3] _et ex esu nemo agnoscet quid manducet._ Dann.
    renders this sentence thus: "Nobody can value this dish
    unless he has partaken of it himself." He is too
    lenient. We would rather translate it literally as we
    did above, or say broadly, "And nobody will be any the
    wiser." List. dwells at length upon this sentence; his
    erudite commentary upon the _cena dubia_, the doubtful
    meal, will be found under the heading of _cena_ in our
    vocabulary. List. pp. 126-7. List. undoubtedly made the
    mistake of reading _sine_ for _sive_. He therefore
    omitted the _apua_ from his formula. The above boastful
    sentence may have induced him to do so.

    The above is a fish forcemeat, now seldom used as an
    integral dish, but still popular as a dressing for fish
    or as quenelles. The modern fish forcemeat is usually
    made of raw fish, cream and eggs, with the necessary
    seasoning. The material is poached or cooked much in the
    same manner as prescribed by the ancient recipe.


[140] A RICH ENTRÉE OF FISH, POULTRY AND SAUSAGE IN CREAM
    _PATINA EX LACTE_

SOAK [pignolia] NUTS, DRY THEM, AND ALSO HAVE FRESH SEA-URCHINS [1]
READY. TAKE A DEEP DISH [casserole] IN WHICH ARRANGE THE FOLLOWING
THINGS [in layers]: MEDIUM-SIZED MALLOWS AND BEETS, MATURE LEEKS,
CELERY, STEWED TENDER GREEN CABBAGE, AND OTHER BOILED GREEN VEGETABLES
[2], A DISJOINTED [3] CHICKEN STEWED IN ITS OWN GRAVY, COOKED [calf's
or pig's] BRAINS, LUCANIAN SAUSAGE, HARD BOILED EGGS CUT INTO HALVES,
BIG TARENTINIAN SAUSAGE [4] SLICED AND BROILED IN THE ASHES, CHICKEN
GIBLETS OR PIECES OF CHICKEN MEAT. BITS OF FRIED FISH, SEA NETTLES,
PIECES OF [stewed] OYSTERS AND FRESH CHEESE ARE ALTERNATELY PUT
TOGETHER; SPRINKLE IN BETWEEN THE NUTS AND WHOLE PEPPER, AND THE JUICE
AS IS COOKED FROM PEPPER, LOVAGE, CELERY SEED AND SILPHIUM. THIS
ESSENCE, WHEN DONE, MIX WITH MILK TO WHICH RAW EGGS HAVE BEEN ADDED
[pour this over the pieces of food in the dish] SO THAT THE WHOLE IS
THOROUGHLY COMBINED, STIFFEN IT [in the hot water bath] AND WHEN DONE
[garnish with] FRESH MUSSELS [sea-urchins, poached and chopped fine]
SPRINKLE PEPPER OVER AND SERVE.

    [3] _Pullum raptum_, in most texts; G.-V. _p.
    carptum_--plucked. Of course! Should _raptum_ be
    translated literally? A most atrocious way of killing
    fowl, to be sure, but anyone familiar with the habits of
    the ancients, particularly with those of the less
    educated element, should not wonder at this most bestial
    fashion, which was supposed to improve the flavor of the
    meat, a fashion which, as a matter of fact still
    survives in the Orient, particularly in China.

    [4] Vat. Ms. _Tarentino farsos_; Tor. cooks the sausage

[141] APICIAN DISH
    _PATINA APICIANA_ [1]

THE APICIAN DISH IS MADE THUS: TAKE SMALL PIECES OF COOKED SOW'S BELLY
[with the paps on it] PIECES OF FISH, PIECES OF CHICKEN, THE BREASTS
OF FIGPECKERS OR OF THRUSHES [slightly] COOKED, [and] WHICHEVER IS
BEST. MINCE ALL THIS VERY CAREFULLY, PARTICULARLY THE FIGPECKERS [the
meat of which is very tender]. DISSOLVE IN OIL STRICTLY FRESH EGGS;
CRUSH PEPPER AND LOVAGE, POUR OVER SOME BROTH AND RAISIN WINE, PUT IT
IN A SAUCEPAN TO HEAT AND BIND WITH ROUX. AFTER YOU HAVE CUT ALL IN
REGULAR PIECES, LET IT COME TO THE BOILING POINT. WHEN DONE, RETIRE
[from the fire] WITH ITS JUICE OF WHICH YOU PUT SOME IN ANOTHER DEEP
PAN WITH WHOLE PEPPER AND PIGNOLIA NUTS. SPREAD [the ragout] OUT IN
SINGLE LAYERS WITH THIN PANCAKES IN BETWEEN; PUT IN AS MANY PANCAKES
AND LAYERS OF MEAT AS IS REQUIRED TO FILL THE DISH; PUT A FINAL COVER
OF PANCAKE ON TOP AND SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AFTER THOSE EGGS HAVE BEEN
ADDED [which serve] TO TIE THE DISH. NOW PUT THIS [mould or dish] IN A
BOILER [steamer, hot water bath, allow to congeal] AND DISH IT OUT [by
unmoulding it]. AN EXPENSIVE SILVER PLATTER WOULD ENHANCE THE
APPEARANCE OF THIS DISH MATERIALLY.

IN A MORTAR PUT PEPPER, LOVAGE AND ORIGANY [3], WHICH CRUSH; MOISTEN
[this] WITH BROTH, WINE, RAISIN WINE AND A LITTLE OIL; EMPTY IT INTO
THE BOWL [with the beaten eggs, mix] AND HEAT IT [in the hot water
bath]. THEREUPON WHEN [this is] THICKENED MIX IT WITH THE PIECES OF
MEAT. NOW PREPARE [alternately] LAYERS OF STEW AND PANCAKES,
INTERSPERSED WITH OIL [in the metal mould reserved for this purpose]
UNTIL FULL, COVER WITH ONE REAL GOOD PANCAKE [4], CUT INTO IT A VENT
HOLE FOR CHIMNEY ON THE SURFACE [bake in hot water bath and when done]
TURN OUT UPSIDE DOWN INTO ANOTHER DISH. SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND
SERVE.

    [1] List. _cottidiana_; G.-V. _cotidiana_. Everyday
    Dish, in contrast to the foregoing Apician dish which is
    more sumptuous on account of the figpeckers or thrushes.
    In the originals these two formulæ are rolled into one.
    Cf. ℞ No. 128.

    [2] G.-V. _Hæc omnia concides_; Tor. _condies_; List.
    _condies lege concides_ which we dispute.
    _Condies_--season, flavor--is more correct in this
    place; _concides_--mince--is a repetition of what has
    been said already.

    a pie.


[143] NUT CUSTARD TURN-OVER [1]
    _PATINA VERSATILIS VICE DULCIS_

PIGNOLIA NUTS, CHOPPED OR BROKEN NUTS [other varieties] ARE CLEANED
AND ROASTED AND CRUSHED WITH HONEY. MIX IN [beat well] PEPPER, BROTH,
MILK, EGGS, A LITTLE HONEY [2] AND OIL. [Thicken slowly on fire
without boiling, fill in moulds, taking care that the nuts do not sink
to the bottom, bake in hot water bath, when cold unmould].

    [1] Practically the only recipe in Apicius fairly
    resembling a modern "dessert." This is practically a
    repetition of ℞ No. 129, which see.

    [2] Tor. _modico melle_; List. _m. mero_--pure wine and
    also pure honey, i.e. thick honey for sweetening. Wine
    would be out of place here. This is an excellent example
    of nut custard, if the "pepper" and the "broth"
    (_liquamen_), of the original, in other words spices and
    brine, or salt, be used very sparingly. For "pepper"
    nutmeg or allspice may be substituted, as is used today
    in such preparations. The oil seems superfluous, but it
    is taking the place of our butter. This very incomplete
    formula is characteristic because of the absence of
    weights and measures and other vital information as to
    the manipulation of the materials. None but an
    experienced practitioner could make use of this formula
    in its original state.

    Goll. adds toasted raisins, for which there is no

    [5] Modern fish _au gratin_ is made in a similar way.
    Instead of this wine sauce a spiced cream sauce and
    grated cheese are mixed with the bits of cooked fish,
    which is then baked in the dish.

    Brains, chicken, etc., too, are served _au gratin_, but
    a combination of the three in one dish is no longer
    practiced. However, the Italian method of baking fish,
    etc., _au gratin à l'Italienne_ contains even more herbs
    and wine reduction than the above formula.


[145] SALT FISH BALLS IN WINE SAUCE [1]
    _PATELLA ARIDA_ [2]

DRY PIECES OF SALT TURSIO [3] ARE BONED, CLEANED [soaked in water,
cooked] SHREDDED FINE AND SEASONED WITH GROUND PEPPER, LOVAGE,
ORIGANY, PARSLEY, CORIANDER, CUMIN, RUE SEEDS AND DRY MINT. MAKE FISH
BALLS OUT OF THIS MATERIAL AND POACH THE SAME IN WINE, BROTH AND OIL;
AND WHEN COOKED, ARRANGE THEM IN A DISH. THEN MAKE A SAUCE [utilizing
the broth, the _court bouillon_ in which the balls were cooked] SEASON
WITH PEPPER, LOVAGE, SATURY, ONIONS AND WINE AND VINEGAR, ALSO ADD
BROTH AND OIL AS NEEDED, BIND WITH ROUX [4] [pour over the balls]
SPRINKLE WITH THYME AND GROUND PEPPER [5].

    [1] Reminding us of the Norwegian _fiske boller_ in wine
    sauce, a popular commercial article found canned in
    delicatessen stores.

    [2] List. _patella sicca_--dry, perhaps because made of
    dried fish.

    [3] List. _isicia de Tursione_; G.-V. _Thursione_.
    Probably a common sturgeon, or porpoise, or dolphin.
    List. describes it as "a kind of salt fish from the
    Black Sea; a malicious fish with a mouth similar to a
    rabbit"; Dann. thinks it is a sturgeon, but in Goll. it
    appears as tunny. The ancients called the sturgeon
    _acipenser_; but this name was gradually changed into
    _styrio_, _stirio_ and _sturio_, which is similar to
    _tursio_ (cf. _styrio_ in the vocabulary). The fish in
    question therefore may have been sturgeon for which the
    Black Sea is famous.

    [4] List., G.-V. _ovis obligabis_--tie with
    eggs--certainly preferable to the Tor. version.

    [5] Tor. thyme.

    The above is an excellent way of making fish balls, it
    being taken for granted, of course, that the salt fish
    be thoroughly soaked and cooked in milk before shaping
    into balls. The many spices should be used very
    moderately, some to be omitted entirely. We read between
    the lines of the old formula that the _Tursio_ had a
    long journey from Pontus to Rome; fish however dry
    acquires a notorious flavor upon such journeys which
    must be offset by herbs and spices.

    It is quite possible that the ancients made a
    _réduction_ of the herbs and spices mentioned in this
    formula; in fact, the presence of vinegar leads us to
    believe this, in which case this formula would be
    nothing but a very modern sauce. The herbs and spices in
    a _réduction_ are crushed and boiled down in vinegar and
    wine, and strained off, they leave their finest flavor
    in the sauce.


[146] VEGETABLE DINNER
    _PATELLA EX OLISATRO_ [1]

[Any kind of vegetables or herbs] BLANCHED OFF IN WATER WITH [a
little] SODA; SQUEEZE [out the water] ARRANGE IN A SAUCEPAN. GRIND
PEPPER, LOVAGE, CORIANDER, SATURY, ONION WITH WINE, BROTH, VINEGAR AND
OIL; ADD [this] TO THE VEGETABLES, STEW [all until nearly done] AND
TIE WITH ROUX. SPRINKLE WITH THYME, FINELY GROUND PEPPER AND SERVE.
ANY KIND OF VEGETABLE [2] MAY BE PREPARED IN THE ABOVE MANNER, IF YOU
WISH.

    [1] Wanting in Tac. and Tor. G.-V. _patellam ex
    holisatro_.

    [2] It is worth noting that Tor. and Tac. omit this
    recipe entirely and that Tor. concludes the preceding
    formula with the last sentence of the above formula,
    except for the difference in one word. Tor. _et de
    quacunque libra_ [List. _et al._ _herba_] _si volueris
    facies ut demonstratum est suprà_. This might mean that
    it is optional (in the preceding formula) to shape the
    fish into one pound loaves instead of the small fish
    balls, which is often done in the case of forcemeats, as
    in veal, beef, ham loaves, or fish pie.

    We are inclined to accept the reading of Torinus, for
    the above way of preparing "any kind of vegetables or
    herbs" is somewhat farfetched. Furthermore, the
    vegetable dish would more properly belong in Book III.

    Just another example of where readings by various
    editors are different because of the interpretations of
    one word. In this case one group reads _libra_ whereas
    the other reads _herba_.


[147] A DISH OF SARDINES
    _PATELLA DE APUA_ [1]

SARDINE LOAF (OR OMELETTE) IS MADE IN THIS MANNER [2] CLEAN THE
SARDINES [of skin and bones]; BREAK [and beat] EGGS AND MIX WITH [half
of the] FISH [3]; ADD TO THIS SOME STOCK, WINE AND OIL, AND FINISH
[the composition] BY HEATING IT. WHEN DONE TO A POINT, ADD [the
remaining part of the] SARDINES TO IT, LET IT STAND A WHILE [over a
slow fire to congeal] CAREFULLY TURN OVER [dish it up] MASK WITH A
WARM [4] WINE SAUCE, SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.

    [1] G.-V. _Patina de apua fricta_--same as _aphya_,
    fried fresh small fish of the kind of anchovies,
    sardines, sprats.

    In experimenting with this formula we would advise to
    use salt and oil judiciously if any at all. We have no
    knowledge of the ancient _apua fricta_ other than our
    making of modern sardines which is to fry them in oil as
    quickly as possible after the fish has left the water,
    for its meat is very delicate. For an omelette, our
    modern sardines, including kippered smelts, sprotten,
    and similar smoked and processed fish, contain
    sufficient salt and fat to season the eggs of an
    omelette.

    [2] Tor. Sentence wanting in other texts.

    [3] Tor. _cum aqua_; List., G.-V. _cum apua_. Perhaps a
    typographical error in Tor. A little water is used to
    dilute the eggs of an omelette, but Apicius already
    prescribes sufficient liquids (stock or brine, wine) for
    that purpose.

    [4] Tor. _et in calore œnogarum perfundes_; List.,
    G.-V. _ut coloret_--to keep the omelette in the pan long
    enough to give it "color." We prefer the Torinus version
    because an omelette should have no or very little color
    from the fire (the eggs thus browned are indigestible)
    and because hot _œnogarum_ (wine-fish sauce, not in
    List.) is accompanying this dish, to give additional
    savour and a finishing touch.


[148] FINE RAGOUT OF BRAINS AND BACON
    _PATINA EX LARIDIS _[1]_ ET CEREBELLIS_

THE DISH OF BACON AND BRAINS IS MADE IN THIS MANNER [2] STRAIN [or
chop fine] HARD BOILED EGGS [3] WITH PARBOILED BRAINS [calf's or
pig's] THE SKIN AND NERVES OF WHICH HAVE BEEN REMOVED; ALSO COOK
CHICKEN GIBLETS, ALL IN PROPORTION TO THE FISH [4] PUT THIS AFORESAID
MIXTURE IN A SAUCEPAN, PLACE THE COOKED BACON IN THE CENTER, GRIND
PEPPER AND LOVAGE AND TO SWEETEN ADD A DASH OF MEAD, HEAT, WHEN HOT
STIR BRISKLY WITH A RUE WHIP AND BIND WITH ROUX.

    [1] G.-V. _lagitis_; Tor. _laridis_ and _largitis_; Vat.
    Ms. _lagatis_; List. _pro lagitis ... legendum
    Lacertis_. The _lacertus_, according to List., is a much
    esteemed salt fish; not identified. List. _et al._ seem
    to be mistaken in their reading of _lacertis_ for
    _laridis_. This work stands for salt pork, from
    _laridum_ and _lardum_ (French, _lard_; the English
    _lard_ is applied to the rendered fat of pork in
    general). Cf. notes to ℞ No. 41.

    [2] Tor. sentence wanting in other texts.

    [3] _oua dura_; Sch. _o. dua_--two eggs.

    [4] This formula would be intelligible and even
    gastronomically correct were it not for this word
    "fish." However, we cannot accept Lister's reading
    _lacertis_. We prefer the reading, _laridis_, bacon. The
    French have another term for this--_petits salés_. Both
    this and the Torinus term are in the plural. They are
    simply small strips of bacon to which Torinus again
    refers in the above formula, _salsum, coctum in media
    pones_--put the bacon, when done, in the center (of the
    dish). Regarding _salsum_ also see note to ℞ No. 41.

    The above dish resembles _ragoût fin en coquille_, a
    popular Continental dish, although its principal
    ingredients are sweetbreads instead of brains.


[149] BROILED MULLET
    _PATINA EX PISCIBUS MULLIS_ [1]

A DISH OF MULLET CONSISTS OF [2] SCALED SALT MULLET PLACED IN A CLEAN
PAN WITH ENOUGH OIL [3] AS IS NECESSARY FOR COOKING; WHEN DONE ADD [a
dash of honey-] WINE OR RAISIN WINE, SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.

    [1] List., G.-V. _mullorum loco salsi_--salt mullet.

    [2] Tor. wanting in other texts.

    [3] List. _liquamen_--broth, brine, which would be worse
    than carrying owls to Athens. As a matter of fact, the
    mullet if it be what List. says, _loco salsi_--salted on
    the spot, i.e. as caught, near the sea shore, requires
    soaking to extract the salt.


[150] A DISH OF ANY KIND OF SALT FISH
    _PATINA EX PISCIBUS QUIBUSLIBET_ [1]

ANOTHER FISH DISH IS THUS MADE [2] FRY ANY KIND OF CURED [3] FISH,
CAREFULLY TREATED [soaked and cleaned] PLACE IN A PAN, COVER WITH
SUFFICIENT OIL, LAY [strips of] COOKED SALT [4] [pork or
bacon--_petits salés_] OVER THE CENTER, KEEP IT HOT, WHEN REAL HOT,
ADD A DASH OF HONEY WINE TO THE GRAVY AND STIR IT UP [5].

    [1] Ex Tor.; G.-V. _P. piscium loco salsi_.

    [2] Tor.; sentence wanting in other texts.

    [3] Tor. _duratos_--_hard_--no sense here, probably a
    misprint of the d. List. _curatos_--carefully treated,
    "cured," processed.

    [4] _Salsum coctum_, cf. notes to ℞ No. 148; Goll.,
    Dann.--sprinkle [the fish] with salt.... Like Lister's
    error in the preceding formula it would be a great
    blunder to add salt to a cured fish already saturated
    with salt to the utmost. Cf. also note 2 to ℞ Nos.
    41, 148.

    [5] Virtually a repetition of ℞ No. 149, except for
    the addition of the pork.


[151] ANOTHER FISH DISH, WITH ONIONS
    _ALIA PISCIUM PATINA_

ANOTHER FISH DISH MAKE AS FOLLOWS [1] CLEAN ANY KIND OF FISH AND PLACE
IT PROPERLY IN A SAUCEPAN WITH SHREDDED DRY ASCALONIAN ONIONS
[shallots] OR WITH ANY OTHER KIND OF ONIONS, THE FISH ON TOP. ADD
STOCK AND OIL AND COOK. WHEN DONE, PUT BROILED BACON IN THE CENTER,
GIVE IT A DASH OF VINEGAR, SPRINKLE WITH [finely chopped] SAVORY AND
GARNISH WITH [the] ONIONS.

    [1] Tor., sentence wanting in other texts.


[152] A LUCRETIAN DISH
    _PATINA LUCRETIANA_ [1]

CLEAN YOUNG ONIONS, REJECTING THE GREEN TOPS, AND PLACE [2] THEM IN A
SAUCEPAN WITH A LITTLE BROTH, SOME OIL AND WATER, AND, TO BE COOKED
[with the onions] PLACE SALT PORK [3] IN THE MIDST [of the scallions].
WHEN NEARLY DONE, ADD A SPOON OF HONEY [4] A LITTLE VINEGAR AND
REDUCED MUST, TASTE IT, IF INSIPID ADD MORE BRINE [broth] IF TOO
SALTY, ADD MORE HONEY, AND SPRINKLE WITH SAVORY [5].

    [1] Dann. Named for Lucretius Epicuræus, a contemporary
    of Cicero. List. _ab authore cui in usu fuit sic
    appellata_.

    [2] G.-V. _concides_. Not necessary.

    [3] _salsum crudum_--salt pork, i.e. not smoked or cured
    bacon. Dann. raw salt; Goll. salt. Impossible, of
    course! Cf. notes to ℞ Nos. 41, 147, 149.

    [4] To glaze the pork, no doubt; reminding us of our own
    use of sugar to glaze ham or bacon, and of the molasses
    added to pork (and beans).

    [5] G.-V. _coronam bubulam_. In experimenting with this
    formula omit salt completely. Instead of honey we have
    also added maple syrup once. To make this a perfect
    luncheon dish a starch is wanting; we have therefore
    added sliced raw potatoes and cooked with the rest, to
    make it a balanced meal, by way of improving upon
    Lucretius. Since the ancients had no potatoes we have,
    on a different occasion, created another version by
    added sliced dasheens (_colocasia_, cf. ℞ Nos. 74,
    216, 244, 322). It is surprising that the ancients who
    used the _colocasium_ extensively did not combine it
    with the above dish.


[153] STEWED LACERTUS FISH
    _PATINA DE LACERTIS_ [1]

CLEAN AND WASH [soak] THE FISH [2] [cook and flake it] BREAK AND BEAT
EGGS, MIX THEM WITH THE FISH, ADD BROTH, WINE AND OIL. PLACE THIS ON
THE FIRE, WHEN COOKED [scrambled] ADD SIMPLE FISH WINE SAUCE [3] TO
IT, SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE [4].

    [1] Ex List. wanting in Tor. G.-V. _P. de lagitis_; cf.
    note to ℞ No. 148.

    [2] Remembering that List. reads _lagitis_ for
    _lacertis_, this formula appears to be an antique
    "Scrambled Eggs and Bacon." Cf. notes to ℞ Nos. 42,
    148-150.

    [3] _Oenogarum_, cf. ℞ No. 147, the Sardine Omelette.

    [4] To cook the eggs as described above would be
    disastrous. The fish, if such was used, was probably
    first poached in the broth, wine and oil, and when done,
    removed from the pan. The _fond_, or remaining juice or
    gravy, was subsequently tied with the egg yolks, and
    this sauce was strained over the fish dressed on the
    service platter, the _œnogarum_ sparingly sprinkled
    over the finished dish. This would closely resemble our
    modern _au vin blanc_ fish dishes; the _œnogarum_
    taking the place of our meat glacé.

    Another interpretation of this vexatious formula is that
    if fish was used, the cooked fish was incorporated with
    the raw beaten eggs which were then scrambled in the
    pan. In that event this formula resembles closely the
    sardine omelette.


[154] A FISH STEW
    _PATINA ZOMORE_ [1]

THE ZOMORE FISH DISH IS MADE AS FOLLOWS [2] TAKE RAW GANONAS [3] AND
OTHER [fish] WHICHEVER YOU LIKE, PLACE THEM IN A SAUCE PAN, ADDING
OIL, BROTH, REDUCED WINE, A BUNCH [4] OF LEEKS AND [green] CORIANDER;
WHILE THIS COOKS, CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE AND A BUNCH OF ORIGANY WHICH
CRUSH BY ITSELF AND DILUTE WITH THE JUICE [5] OF THE FISH. NOW
DISSOLVE [break and beat egg yolks for a _liaison_] PREPARE AND TASTE
THE DISH, BINDING [the sauce with the yolks] SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND
SERVE.

    [1] List. _Zomoteganite_--"a dish of fish boiled in
    their own liquor"; G.-V. _zomoteganon_; Lan.
    _zomoreganonas_; Vat. Ms. _zomonam Ganas_.

    Coote, cit. Apiciana; the proof of the antiquity and the
    genuineness of Apicius.


[155] SOLE IN WHITE WINE
    _PATINA EX SOLEIS_ [1]

A DISH OF SOLE IS THUS MADE [2] BEAT THE SOLE [3] PREPARE [4] AND
PLACE THEM IN A [shallow] SAUCE PAN, ADD OIL, BROTH AND WINE, AND
POACH THEM THUS; NOW CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, ORIGANY AND ADD OF THE FISH
JUICE; THEN BIND THE SAUCE WITH RAW EGGS [yolks] TO MAKE A GOOD CREAMY
SAUCE OF IT; STRAIN THIS OVER THE SOLE, HEAT ALL ON A SLOW FIRE [to
fill it with live heat] SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE [5].

    [1] G.-V. _P. solearum_.

    [2] Tor. sentence wanting in other texts.

    [3] Beat, to make tender, to be able to remove the skin.

    [4] Tor. _curatos_--trim, skin, remove entrails, wash.

    [5] One of the best of Apician accomplishments. Exactly
    like our modern _sole au vin blanc_, one of the most
    aristocratic of dishes. Cf. ℞ No. 487, Excerpta, XIX.


[155a] FISH LIQUOR
     _PATINA EX PISCIBUS_

A LIQUOR [in which to cook fish] IS MADE BY TAKING [1] ONE OUNCE OF
PEPPER, ONE PINT OF REDUCED WINE, ONE PINT OF SPICED WINE AND TWO

[156] A DISH OF LITTLE FISH
    _PATINA DE PISCICULIS_ [1]

TAKE RAISINS, PEPPER, LOVAGE, ORIGANY, ONIONS, WINE, BROTH AND OIL,
PLACE THIS IN A PAN; AFTER THIS HAS COOKED ADD TO IT THE COOKED SMALL
FISH, BIND WITH ROUX AND SERVE.

    [1] Smelts, anchovies, whitebait.


[157] A DISH OF TOOTH FISH, DORY OR SEA MULLET AND OYSTERS
    _PATINA DE PISCIBUS DENTICE, AURATA ET MUGILE_ [1]

TAKE THE FISH, PREPARE [clean, trim, wash] AND HALF BROIL OR FRY THEM;
THEREUPON SHRED THEM [in good-sized] PIECES: NEXT PREPARE OYSTERS; PUT
IN A MORTAR 6 SCRUPLES OF PEPPER, MOISTEN WITH BROTH AND CRUSH. ADD A
SMALL GLASS OF BROTH, ONE OF WINE TO IT; PUT IN A SAUCE PAN 3 OUNCES
OF OIL AND THE [shelled] OYSTERS AND LET THEM POACH WITH WINE SAUCE.
WHEN THEY ARE DONE, OIL A DISH ON WHICH PLACE THE ABOVE MENTIONED FISH
PIECES AND STEWED OYSTERS, HEAT AGAIN, AND WHEN HOT, BREAK 40 [2] EGGS
[whip them] AND POUR THEM OVER THE OYSTERS, SO THAT THEY CONGEAL.
SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE. [3].

    [1] _dentex_--"tooth-fish"; _aurata_--"gilt"--dory, red
    snapper; _mugilis_--Sea Mullet, according to some.

    [2] G.-V. _ova XI_--11 eggs. Tac. _ova Xl_, which may be
    read XL--forty.

    [3] This dish may be allowed to congeal slowly; if done
    quickly it may become a dish of scrambled eggs with fish
    and oysters.


[158] SEA BASS, OR BARRACUDA
    _PATINA DE LUPO_ [1]

GRIND PEPPER, CUMIN, PARSLEY, RUE, ONIONS, HONEY, BROTH, RAISIN WINE
AND DROPS OF OIL [2].

    [1] G.-V. _p. de pisce lupo_--wolf, because of its
    voracity; a sea fish, sea pike, or sea bass; perhaps
    akin to our barracuda, wolfish both in appearance and
    character. Sch. _Perca labrax_ Lin.

    [2] The cleaned fish is cut into convenient portions or
    fillets, placed in an oiled pan, the ingredients spread
    over; it is either poached in the oven or cooked under
    the open fire.

SEA-NETTLES, WASH AND DRAIN THEM ON THE COLANDER, DRY ON THE TABLE AND
CHOP FINE. CRUSH 10 SCRUPLES OF PEPPER, MOISTEN WITH BROTH, ADD 2
SMALL GLASSES OF BROTH AND 6 OUNCES OF OIL. HEAT THIS IN A SAUCE PAN
AND WHEN COOKED TAKE IT OUT AND ALLOW TO COOL OFF. NEXT OIL A CLEAN
PAN, BREAK 8 EGGS AND BEAT THEM; COMBINE THESE WITH THE ABOVE
PREPARATIONS, PLACE THE PAN ON HOT ASHES TO GIVE IT HEAT FROM BELOW,

THE APICIAN MINUTAL IS MADE AS FOLLOWS: [1] OIL, BROTH WINE, LEEK
HEADS, MINT, SMALL FISH, SMALL TIDBITS [2] COCK'S FRIES OR CAPON'S
KIDNEYS [3] AND PORK SWEETBREADS; ALL OF THESE ARE COOKED TOGETHER [4]
NOW CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, GREEN CORIANDER, OR SEEDS, MOISTENED WITH
BROTH; ADD A LITTLE HONEY, AND OF THE OWN LIQUOR [5] OF THE ABOVE
MORSELS, WINE AND HONEY TO TASTE; BRING THIS TO A BOILING POINT SKIM,
BIND, STIR WELL [strain, pour over the morsels] SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER
AND SERVE [6].

    [1] Tor. sentence wanting in other texts.

    [2] _isitia_--_quenelles_, dumplings of some kind,
    mostly fine forcemeats.

    [3] _testiculi caponum_; the capon has no _testiculi_,
    these organs having been removed by an operation when
    the cock is young. This operation is said to have been
    first performed by a Roman surgeon with the intention of
    beating the _Lex Fannia_, or Fannian law, sponsored by a
    fanatic named Fannius. It prohibited among other
    restrictions the serving of any fowl at any time or
    repast except a hen, and this hen was not to be
    fattened. Note the cunning of the law: The useful hen
    and her unlaid eggs could be sacrificed while the
    unproductive rooster was allowed to thrive to no
    purpose, immune from the butcher's block. This set the
    shrewd surgeon to thinking; he transformed a rooster
    into a capon by his surgical trick. The emasculated bird
    grew fat without his owner committing any infraction of
    the Roman law against fattening chickens. Of course the
    capon, being neither hen nor rooster, was perfectly safe
    to eat, for he was within the law. Thus he became a huge
    success as an ancient "bootleg" chicken.

    [4] These integral parts must be prepared and poached
    separately and merely heated together before the final
    service.

    [5] Again the Plautian colloquialism _ius de suo sibi_.

    [6] This dish is worthy of Apicius. It is akin to our
    _Ragoût Financière_, and could pass for _Vol-au-vent à
    la Financière_ if it were served in a large fluffy crust
    of puff paste.


[167] MINUTAL À LA MATIUS [1]
    _MINUTAL MATIANUM_

PUT IN A SAUCE PAN OIL, BROTH FINELY CHOPPED LEEKS, CORIANDER, SMALL
TID-BITS, COOKED PORK SHOULDER, CUT INTO LONG STRIPS INCLUDING THE
SKIN, HAVE EVERYTHING EQUALLY HALF DONE. ADD MATIAN APPLES [2]
CLEANED, THE CORE REMOVED, SLICED LENGTHWISE AND COOK THEM TOGETHER:
MEANWHILE CRUSH PEPPER, CUMIN, GREEN CORIANDER, OR SEEDS, MINT, LASER
ROOT, MOISTENED WITH VINEGAR, HONEY AND BROTH AND A LITTLE REDUCED
MUST, ADD TO THIS THE BROTH OF THE ABOVE MORSELS, VINEGAR TO TASTE,
BOIL, SKIM, BIND [strain over the morsels] SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND
SERVE.

    [1] Named for Matius, ancient author, or because of the
    Matian apples used in this dish, also named for the same
    man. Plinius, Nat. Hist. lib. XV, Cap. 14-15, Columella,
    De re Rustica, lib. XII, Cap. XLIIII.

    This is not the first instance where fruits or
    vegetables were named for famous men. Beets, a certain
    kind of them were named for Varro, writer on
    agriculture. Matius, according to Varro, wrote a book on
    waiters, cooks, cellar men and food service in general,
    of which there is no trace today. It was already lost
    during Varro's days.

    [2] Cf. note 1, above. This illustrates the age-old
    connection of pork and apples.


[168] SWEET MINUTAL
    _MINUTAL DULCE_ [1]

IN A SAUCE PAN PUT TOGETHER OIL, BROTH, COCTURA [2] FINELY CUT LEEK
HEADS AND GREEN CORIANDER, COOKED PORK SHOULDER, SMALL TID-BITS. WHILE
THIS IS BEING COOKED, CRUSH PEPPER, CUMIN, CORIANDER OR [its] SEEDS,
GREEN RUE, LASER ROOT, MOISTENED WITH VINEGAR, REDUCED MUST AND THE
GRAVY OF THE ABOVE MORSELS; ADD VINEGAR TO TASTE: WHEN THIS [sauce] IS
COOKED, HOLLOW OUT CITRON SQUASH [3] CUT IN DICE, BOIL AND PLACE THEM
TOGETHER WITH THE REST IN THE DISH, SKIM, BIND [strain] THE SAUCE
[pour it over the morsels] SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.

    [1] G.-V. _m. ex citriis_.

    [2] At this late point Apicius commences to use the term
    _coctura_ which does not designate any particular
    ingredient but rather stands for a certain process of
    cookery, depending upon the ingredients used in the
    dish. We would here interpret it as the frying of the
    leeks in oil, etc. In another instance _coctura_ may
    mean our modern _réduction_.

    [3] The fruit to be used here has not been
    satisfactorily identified. The texts have _citrium_ and
    _citrum_--a sweet squash or cucumber--perhaps even a
    melon, but not the citron, the _mala citrea_ as read by
    List. This specimen is hard to identify because of the
    many varieties in the cucumber, squash and the citrus
    families. _Citrus_, as a matter of fact, is but a
    corruption of _cedrus_, the cedar tree.

    We are not sure whether this fruit is to be stuffed with
    the ragout and then baked, as is often the custom to do
    with such shells; the texts prescribes distinctly to
    hollow out the fruit.

    The title, implying a "sweet dish" is obviously wrong.

    It may be remarked here that Apicius makes no mention of
    that marvelous citrus fruit, the lemon, nor of the
    orange, both of which are indispensable to modern
    cookery.


[169] MINUTAL OF FRUIT
    _MINUTAL EX PRÆCOQUIS_

IN A SAUCE PAN PUT OIL, BROTH AND WINE, FINELY CUT SHALLOTS, DICED
COOKED PORK SHOULDER. WHEN THIS IS COOKED, CRUSH PEPPER, CUMIN, DRY
MINT, DILL, MOISTEN WITH HONEY, BROTH, RAISIN WINE [and] A LITTLE
VINEGAR, SOME OF THE GRAVY OF THE ABOVE MORSELS, ADD FRUITS THE SEEDS
OF WHICH HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT, LET BOIL, WHEN THOROUGHLY COOKED, SKIM,
BIND, SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE [1].

    [1] This, rather than ℞ No. 168, deserves the title,
    Sweet Minutal, for it is practically the same, with the
    addition of the fruit.


[170] MINUTAL OF HARE'S LIVERS
    _MINUTAL LEPORINUM_

THE WAY TO MAKE A MINUTAL OF HARE'S GIBLETS MAY BE FOUND AMONG THE
HARE RECIPES [1].

[170a] IN A SAUCE PAN PUT OIL, BROTH AND WINE, FINELY CUT SHALLOTS,
DICED COOKED PORK SHOULDER. WHEN THIS IS COOKED, CRUSH PEPPER, CUMIN,
DRY MINT, DILL, MOISTEN WITH HONEY, BROTH, RAISIN WINE [and] A LITTLE
VINEGAR, SOME OF THE GRAVY OF THE ABOVE MORSELS, ADD SEEDLESS FRUITS,
LET BOIL, WHEN THOROUGHLY COOKED, SKIM, BIND, SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND
SERVE.

    [1] ℞ No. 386, Book VIII is one of these recipes.
    This is one of the few instances where the ancient
    original makes any reference to any other part of the
    Apicius book.* After this bare reference, the original
    proceeds to repeat the text of the preceding formula
    verbatim.

    * Cf. ℞ No. 165.

    Brandt suggests a new title for [170a] ANOTHER SWEET
    MINUTAL.

    The G.-V. version differs but little from ℞ No. 169.


[171] RED APPLE MINUTAL
    _MINUTAL EX ROSIS_ [1]

MAKE THIS THE SAME WAY AS DESCRIBED IN THE FOREGOING, ONLY ADD MORE
RAISIN WINE.

    [1] List. Roses; Tor. _Rosatium_; this term, medieval
    Latin, does not exist in the ancient language.

    Sch. _mala rosea_--rosy or red apple, most likely to be
    the correct interpretation. Cf. ℞ Nos. 136 and 167.

    The above title has led to the belief that the ancients
    made pies, etc., of roses, an idea that was much
    ridiculed in England after the publication of Lister's
    work in 1705.

    We concur with Schuch's interpretation that rosy apples
    were used, remembering, however, that the fruit of the
    rose tree, the hip, dog-briar, eglantine is also made
    into dainty confections on the Continent today. It is
    therefore entirely possible that this recipe calls for
    the fruit of the rose tree.

GRUELS
  _TISANAM VEL SUCUM_


[172] BARLEY BROTH, PAP, PORRIDGE, GRUEL
    _TISANA SIVE CREMORE_ [1]

CRUSH BARLEY, SOAKED THE DAY BEFORE, WELL WASHED, PLACE ON THE FIRE
TO BE COOKED [in a double boiler] WHEN HOT ADD ENOUGH OIL, A BUNCH OF
DILL, DRY ONION, SATURY AND COLOCASIUM [2] TO BE COOKED TOGETHER
BECAUSE FOR THE BETTER JUICE, ADD GREEN CORIANDER AND A LITTLE SALT;
BRING IT TO A BOILING POINT. WHEN DONE TAKE OUT THE BUNCH [of dill]
AND TRANSFER THE BARLEY INTO ANOTHER KETTLE TO AVOID STICKING TO THE
BOTTOM AND BURNING, MAKE IT LIQUID [by addition of water, broth, milk]
STRAIN INTO A POT, COVERING THE TOPS OF THE COLOCASIA. NEXT CRUSH
PEPPER, LOVAGE, A LITTLE DRY FLEA-BANE, CUMIN AND SYLPHIUM [3] STIR IT
WELL AND ADD VINEGAR, REDUCED MUST AND BROTH; PUT IT BACK INTO THE
POT, THE REMAINING COLOCASIA FINISH ON A GENTLE FIRE [4].

    [1] Tor. _ptisana siue Cremore_.

    [2] G.-V. _Colœfium_; Tor. _colœsium_ and
    _colesium_ (the different readings perhaps on account of
    the similarity of the "long" s with the f). Tor. spells
    this word differently every time he is confronted with
    it. Tac., Lan. _coledium_--unidentified. List.
    _colocasium_, which see in notes to ℞ Nos. 74, 200,
    216, 244, and 322, also Sch. p. 95.

    [3] List. _sil frictum_; Tor. _silphium f._

    [4] Tor. continuing without interruption. This formula
    is reported in ℞ No. 200.


[173] ANOTHER TISANA
    _TISANA TARICHA_ [1]

THE CEREAL [2] IS SOAKED; CHICKPEAS, LENTILS AND PEAS ARE CRUSHED AND
BOILED WITH IT; WHEN WELL COOKED, ADD PLENTY OF OIL. NOW CUT GREEN
HERBS, LEEKS, CORIANDER, DILL, FENNEL, BEETS, MALLOWS, CABBAGE
STRUNKS, ALL SOFT AND GREEN AND FINELY CUT, AND PUT IN A POT. THE
CABBAGE COOK [separately. Also] CRUSH FENNEL SEED, ORIGANY, SYLPHIUM
AND LOVAGE, AND WHEN CRUSHED, ADD BROTH TO TASTE, POUR THIS OVER THE
PORRIDGE, STIR IT TOGETHER AND USE SOME FINELY CHOPPED CABBAGE STEMS
TO SPRINKLE ON TOP [2].

    [1] Variants: _barrica_, _farrica_; List. _legendum,
    puto, Taricam; id. est Salsam_. Cf. ℞ 144, 149,
    426-8. Lan., Tor., G.-V. _barricam_, not identified.
    Sch. _farrica_--corn spelt; probably not far from the
    mark. We would venture to suggest that our "farina" is
    the thing here used, or any ordinary corn meal.

    [2] This formula is repeated in ℞ No. 201.

HORS D'ŒUVRES, APPETIZERS, RELISHES
  _GUSTUM_


[174] "MOVEABLE" APPETIZERS
    _GUSTUM VERSATILE_

THE MOVEABLE [1] APPETIZERS ARE THUS MADE: [2] SMALL WHITE BEETS,
MATURE LEEKS, CELERY ROOTS [3] STEWED COCKLES [4] GINGER [5] CHICKEN
GIBLETS, SMALL FOWL [6] SMALL MORSELS COOKED IN THEIR OWN LIQUOR [7].
OIL A PAN, LINE IT WITH MALLOW LEAVES AND A COMPOSITION OF DIFFERENT
VEGETABLES, AND, IF YOU HAVE ROOM ENOUGH, BULBS, DAMASCUS PLUMS,
SNAILS, TID-BITS [8] SHORT LUCANIAN SAUSAGE SLICED; ADD BROTH, OIL,
WINE, VINEGAR PUT ON THE FIRE TO HEAT AND SO COOK THEM. MEANWHILE
CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, GINGER, A LITTLE TARRAGON, MOISTEN IT AND LET IT
COOK. BREAK SEVERAL EGGS IN A DISH, USE THE REMAINING LIQUOR IN THE
MORTAR TO MIX IT WITH THE SAUCE IN THE DISH AND TO BIND IT. WHEN THIS
IS DONE, MAKE A WINE SAUCE FOR IT AS FOLLOWS: CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE,
MOISTENED WITH BROTH, RAISIN WINE TO TASTE; IN A SMALL SAUCE PAN PUT A
LITTLE OIL [with the other ingredients] HEAT, AND BIND WITH ROUX WHEN
HOT. NOW [unmould] UPSET THE DISH ON A PLATTER, REMOVE THE MALLOW
LEAVES, POUR OVER THE WINE SAUCE, SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE [9].

    [1] Moveable, either because it is one show piece that
    is carried from one guest to another, or, as here
    indicated, a dish that is to be unmoulded or turned out
    of its mould or pan before service.

    [2] Tor. sentence wanting in other texts.

    [3] Celery roots, i.e. the thick bulbs. G.-V. _apios,
    bulbos_--celery, onions; note the comma after _apios_.

    [4] Periwinkles, also snails.

    [5] Tac., Lan. _gingibera_; Tor. _zinziber_; Vat. Ms.
    _gibera_; G.-V. _Gigeria_; Hum. _id._--giblets. Wanting
    in List.

    [6] List. _avicellas_; Vat. Ms. _aucellare_ and
    _scellas_; Tac., Lan. _id._; Tor. _pullorum
    axillas_--chicken wings (?); G.-V. _ascellas_.

    [7] _ex iure._

    [8] _isitia_--quenelles of forcemeat, etc.

    [9] An extremely complicated composition of varied
    morsels, definite instructions lacking, however. It is
    not clear whether the dish was served hot (in which case
    the dish would not stand up long) or whether served
    cold, jellyfied. Moreover, the title _gustum_--_hors
    d'œuvres_--is not consistent either with similar
    creations by Apicius or with our own notions of such
    dishes. This title may merely suggest that such a dish
    was to be served at the beginning of a repast. This
    recipe presents an instance of the difficulty to render
    the text and its variants in a manner acceptable to our
    modern palates.

    We are of the opinion that the above recipe is a
    contraction of two or more formulæ, each of which,
    separately, might make acceptable hot appetizers.


[175] VEGETABLE RELISH [1]
    _GUSTUM DE OLERIBUS_ [2]

FOR THIS VEGETABLE DISH BOIL BULBS [3] [in] BROTH, OIL, AND WINE; WHEN
DONE [add] LIVER OF SUCKLING PIG [4] CHICKEN LIVERS AND FEET AND SMALL
BIRDS [5] CUT IN HALVES, ALL TO BE COOKED WITH THE BULBS. WHEN DONE,
CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, MOISTENED WITH BROTH, WINE, RAISIN WINE TO
SWEETEN IT. ADD OF THE OWN LIQUOR OF THE MORSELS, RETIRE THE ONIONS,
WHEN DONE [group the morsels together in the service dish] BIND [the
sauce] WITH ROUX IN THE LAST MOMENT [strain over the morsels] AND
SERVE.

    [1] An entremet of fowl and livers.

    [2] a misnomer, as vegetables play the least part in
    this dish.

    [3] Onions, etc.

    [4] _jecinora porcelli_; Sch. _iscinera porcellum_.

    [5] Tor. _axillas_ and _scellas_; see note 6 to ℞
    174.


[176] STUFFED PUMPKIN FRITTERS
    _GUSTUM DE CUCURBITIS FARSILIBUS_

A DISH OF STUFFED PUMPKIN [1] IS MADE THUS: [2] PEEL AND CUT THE
PUMPKIN LENGTHWISE INTO OBLONG PIECES WHICH HOLLOW OUT AND PUT IN A
COOL PLACE. THE DRESSING FOR THE SAME MAKE IN THIS WAY: CRUSH PEPPER,
LOVAGE AND ORIGANY, MOISTENED WITH BROTH; MINCE COOKED BRAINS AND BEAT
RAW EGGS AND MIX ALL TOGETHER TO FORM A PASTE; ADD BROTH AS TASTE
REQUIRES. STUFF THE ABOVE PREPARED PIECES OF PUMPKIN THAT HAVE NOT
BEEN FULLY COOKED WITH THE DRESSING; FIT TWO PIECES TOGETHER AND CLOSE
THEM TIGHT [holding them by means of strings or skewers]. [Now poach
them and] TAKE THE COOKED ONES OUT AND FRY THEM [3]. [The proper] WINE
SAUCE [for this dish] MAKE THUS: CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE MOISTENED WITH
WINE, RAISIN WINE TO TASTE, A LITTLE OIL, PLACE IN PAN TO BE COOKED;
WHEN DONE BIND WITH ROUX. COVER THE FRIED PUMPKIN WITH THIS SAUCE,
SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE [4].

    [1] Dann. cucumbers, for which there is no authority.
    Cucumbers lend themselves equally well for a dish of
    this kind; they are often stuffed with a forcemeat of
    finely minced meats, mushrooms, eggs, breadcrumbs, or
    simply with raw sausage meat, cooked as above, and
    served as a garnish with _entrées_.

    [2] Tor. sentence wanting in other texts.

    [3] Presumably in deep fat or oil, a procedure which
    would require previous breading in bread crumbs or
    enveloping in frying batter.

    [4] Whether you like pumpkin and brains or not--Apicius
    in this dish reveals himself as the consummate master of
    his art that he really is--a cook for cooks; Moreover,
    the lucidity of his diction in this instance is equally
    remarkable. It stands out in striking contrast to his
    many other formulæ which are so obscured. Many of them
    perhaps were precepts of likewise striking originality
    as this one just cited.


[177] COMPÔTE OF EARLY FRUIT
    _GUSTUM DE PRÆCOQUIS_

CLEAN HARD-SKINNED EARLY FRUITS [1] REMOVE THE SEEDS AND KEEP THEM
COLD IN A PAN. CRUSH PEPPER [2] DRY MINT, MOISTENED WITH BROTH, ADDING
HONEY, RAISIN WINE, WINE AND VINEGAR; POUR THIS OVER THE FRUIT IN THE
PAN, ADDING A LITTLE OIL. STEW SLOWLY ON A WEAK FIRE, THICKEN [the
juice] WITH ROUX [rice flour or other starch diluted with water]
SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER [2] AND SERVE [3].

    [1] Lister praises the early green fruit and the use
    thereof, and, as a physician, recommends imitation of
    the above as follows: _In aliis plurimis locis hujus
    fructus mentio fit; ususque mirabilis fuit; & certe
    propter salubritatem, nostram imitationem meretur._

    [2] We do not like the "pepper" in this connection and
    we venture to suggest that in this case the term
    probably stands for some other kind of aromatic seed
    less pungent than the grain known to us as "pepper" and
    one more acceptable to the fine flavor of fruit, namely
    pimiento, allspice for instance, or clove, or nutmeg, or
    a mixture of these. "Pepper" formerly was a generic term
    for all of these spices but was gradually confined to
    the grain pepper of black and white varieties.

    [3] We concur with Lister's idea of the use of early
    fruits. The use of early and unripe fruit for this and
    similar purposes is excellent. The above formula is a
    good example of our own "spiced" peaches, pears, etc.,
    usually taken as a relish. Of course, we use sugar
    instead of honey for sweetening, and brandy instead of
    wine; but the underlying principles are alike.

    This is a good illustration of and speaks well for the
    economy and the ingenuity of the ancients.

Wine was kept in these great jugs, tightly sealed with plaster and
pitch, properly dated and labeled, often remaining for many years.
Some writers mention wine thus kept for a hundred years; the porosity
of the earthen crocks, often holding fifty gallons or more, allowed
evaporation, so that the wine in time became as thick as oil or honey,
which necessitated diluting with water.

Smaller amphoræ, with various vintages readily mixed, were kept cool
in "bars" very similar to our present ice cream cabinets, ready for
service for the guests in tavern rooms.

Elaborate dippers (see our illustration) were used to draw the wine
from the amphoræ.}

    [2] _Puls_--formerly a simple porridge of various kinds
    of cereals or legumes, eaten by the Romans before bread
    came into use. _Puls_ remained in use after the
    introduction of bread only as a food of the poor. It was
    also used at sacrifices. The _pultes_ and _pulticulæ_
    given by Apicius are illustrations of the ever-present
    desire to improve--to glorify, as it were, a thing which
    once was or still is of vital importance in the daily
    life of humans. The _nouveaux-riches_ of the ancient and
    the modern world cannot find it easy to separate
    themselves from their traditions nor are they wont to
    put up with their plainness, hence the fancy trimmings.
    The development of the American pie is a curious analogy
    in this respect. We see in this the intricate working of
    human culture, its eternal strife for perfection. And
    perfection is synonymous with decay. The fare of the
    Carthusian monks, professed, stern vegetarians,
    underwent the same tortuous evolution.

    [3] Named for Didius Julianus, the emperor who was a
    vegetarian. Of course, his majesty could not live on a
    plain porridge, hence the Apician artistry. The _pultes_
    were popular with the many professed vegetarians though
    the obliging cooks mixed finely ground meat in this and
    other porridges.

    Our various cream soups and legume purées--those most
    salubrious creations of modern cookery are no doubt
    lineal descendants from the Apician _pultes_. They are
    so scarce comparatively because they require all the
    ingenuity and resourcefulness of a gifted cook to be
    perfect.

BREAK ROUND BREAD INTO IT [2] DRY, STIR WELL TO PREVENT BURNING; ADD
WATER AS NECESSARY [3].

    [1] Tor. _pulticula tractogala_.

    [2] List. _tres orbiculos tractæ_; Tor. _teres
    sorbiculos tractæ_.

    _Tractum_ is a piece of pastry, a round bread or roll in
    this case, stale, best suited for this purpose.

    [3] The text continues without interruption.


[182] HONEY PAP
    _SIMILITER_

HONEY AND MEAD ARE TREATED SIMILARLY, MIXED WITH MILK, WITH THE
ADDITION OF SALT AND A LITTLE OIL.


[178-183] PULSE
        _PULTES_ [1]

    [1] Tor. _Alia pulticula_.

    This is a verbatim repetition of ℞ No. 178.



II

LENTILS
  _LENTICULA_ [1]


[183] LENTILS AND COW-PARSNIPS
    _LENTICULA EX SPONDYLIS SIVE FONDYLIS_ [2]

PUT THE LENTILS IN A CLEAN SAUCE PAN [and cook with salt]. IN THE
MORTAR CRUSH PEPPER, CUMIN, CORIANDER SEED, MINT, RUE, AND FLEA-BANE,
MOISTENED WITH VINEGAR, ADD HONEY AND BROTH AND REDUCED MUST, VINEGAR
TO TASTE AND PUT THIS IN A SAUCE PAN. THE COOKED COW-PARSNIPS CRUSH,
HEAT [mix with the lentils] WHEN THOROUGHLY COOKED, TIE, ADD GREEN
[fresh olive] OIL AND SERVE IN AN APPROPRIATE DISH [3].

    [1] Tor. _De Lenticula et Castaneis_.

    [2] List. again: _ex spongiolis sive fungulis_. See
    notes to ℞ Nos. 115-120 and 431.

    [3] _Boletar_--a "mushroom" dish. G.-V. _in boletari_;
    Tac. _insuper oleum uiridem mittis_; Tor.
    _inuolutari_--unidentified.


[184] LENTILS [1] AND CHESTNUTS
    _LENTICULAM DE CASTANEIS_ [2]

TAKE A NEW SAUCE PAN, PLACE THEREIN THE CHESTNUTS CAREFULLY CLEANED
[3] ADD WATER AND A LITTLE SODA AND PLACE ON THE FIRE TO BE COOKED.
THIS DONE, CRUSH IN THE MORTAR PEPPER, CUMIN, CORIANDER SEED, MINT,
RUE, LASER ROOT AND FLEA-BANE MOISTENED WITH VINEGAR, HONEY AND BROTH;
ADD VINEGAR TO TASTE AND POUR THIS OVER THE COOKED CHESTNUTS, ADD OIL
AND ALLOW TO BOIL. WHEN DONE CRUSH IT IN THE MORTAR [4]. TASTE TO SEE
IF SOMETHING IS MISSING AND IF SO, PUT IT IN, AND AT LAST ADD GREEN
[fresh virgin] OIL.

    [1] Lentils are omitted in this formula; therefore see
    the following formula.

    [2] Thus G.-V.; Tor. Chestnuts.

    [3] i.e. peeled and skinned. To do this easily, boil the
    chestnuts with the skin, whereupon the outer brown shell
    and the inner membrane are easily removed.

    [4] To make a purée of the chestnuts which strain
    through the colander.


[184a] ANOTHER WAY [1]
     _ALITER LENTICULAM_

COOK THE LENTILS, SKIM THEM [strain] ADD LEEKS, GREEN CORIANDER; CRUSH
CORIANDER SEED, FLEA-BANE, LASER ROOT, MINT SEED AND RUE SEED
MOISTENED WITH VINEGAR; ADD HONEY, BROTH, VINEGAR, REDUCED MUST TO
TASTE, THEN OIL, STIRRING [the purée] UNTIL IT IS DONE, BIND WITH
ROUX, ADD GREEN OIL, SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.

    [1] It is evident that ℞ No. 184 and the above are
    really one formula, the former dealing with the cooking
    of the maroons, the latter describing the lentils.
    Presumably the two purées are to be mixed, or to be
    served as integral parts of one dish.



III


[185] PEAS
    _DE PISIS_

COOK THE PEAS, WHEN SKIMMED, LAY LEEKS, CORIANDER AND CUMIN ON TOP.
CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, CUMIN, DILL AND GREEN BASILICA, WINE AND BROTH
TO TASTE, MAKE IT BOIL; WHEN DONE STIR WELL, PUT IN WHAT PERCHANCE
SHOULD BE MISSING AND SERVE [1].

    [1] This reminds us of _Petits Pois à la Française_,
    namely green peas (often very young ones with the pods)
    cooked in broth, or _bouillon_, with shredded bacon,
    lettuce, parsley, onions (or leeks, as above) fresh
    mint, pepper, salt and other fresh herbs such as
    chervil. Which is a very delectable way of preparing the
    tender pea. Some of its refreshing green color is
    sacrificed by this process, but this loss is amply
    offset by the savour of the dish.


[186] PEAS [supreme style]
    _PISA FARSILIS_ [1]

COOK THE PEAS WITH OIL AND A PIECE OF SOW'S BELLY [2] PUT IN A SAUCE
PAN BROTH, LEEK HEADS [the lower white part] GREEN CORIANDER AND PUT
ON THE FIRE TO BE COOKED. OF TID-BITS [3] CUT LITTLE DICE. SIMILARLY
COOK THRUSHES OR OTHER SMALL [game] BIRDS, OR TAKE SLICED CHICKEN AND
DICED BRAIN, PROPERLY COOKED. FURTHER COOK, IN THE AVAILABLE LIQUOR OR
BROTH, LUCANIAN SAUSAGE AND BACON; COOK LEEKS IN WATER; CRUSH A PINT
OF TOASTED PIGNOLIA NUTS; ALSO CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, ORIGANY AND
GINGER, DILUTE WITH THE BROTH OF PORK, TIE [4] TAKE A SQUARE BAKING
DISH SUITABLE FOR TURNING OVER WHICH OIL WELL AND LINE WITH CAUL [5]
SPRINKLE [on the bottom] A LAYER OF CRUSHED NUTS UPON WHICH PUT SOME
PEAS, FULLY COVERING THE BOTTOM OF THE SQUASH DISH; ON TOP OF THIS
ARRANGE SLICES OF THE BACON [6] LEEKS AND SLICED LUCANIAN SAUSAGE;
AGAIN COVER WITH A LAYER OF PEAS AND ALTERNATE ALL THE REST OF THE
AVAILABLE EDIBLES IN THE MANNER DESCRIBED UNTIL THE DISH IS FILLED,
CONCLUDING AT LAST WITH A LAYER OF PEAS, UTILIZING EVERYTHING. BAKE
THIS DISH IN THE OVEN, OR PUT IT INTO A SLOW FIRE [covering it with
live coal] SO THAT IT MAY BE BAKED THOROUGHLY. [Next make a sauce of
the following] PUT YOLKS OF HARD BOILED EGGS IN THE MORTAR WITH WHITE
PEPPER, NUTS, HONEY, WHITE WINE AND A LITTLE BROTH; MIX AND PUT IT
INTO A SAUCE PAN TO BE COOKED; WHEN [the sauce is] DONE, TURN OUT THE
PEAS INTO A LARGE [silver dish] AND MASK THEM WITH THIS SAUCE WHICH IS
CALLED WHITE SAUCE [7].

    [1] List. _Pisa farsilis_; Tor. _p. farsilia_; Tac.,
    G.-V. _pisam farsilem_--same as _fartilis_, from
    _farcio_--fattened, stuffed, or crammed, or as full as
    it can hold, metaphorically perhaps "supreme style,"
    "most sumptuous," etc.

    [2] This meat being fat enough, the oil seems
    superfluous.

    [3] _isicia_, formerly called Greek _hysitia_--any fine
    forcemeats, cut into or cooked in tiny dumplings.

    [4] _Liaison_ wanting in Tor.

    [5] Tor. makes no mention of the square dish and its
    caul lining. Caul is the abdominal membrane.

    [6] _petasonis pulpas_; Dann. ham, which is not quite
    correct. The _petaso_ is the shoulder part of pork,
    either cured or fresh, generally fresh. The cooked pork
    shoulder here is cut into small pieces. Nothing is said
    about the utilization of the sow's belly mentioned at
    the opening of the formula. We assume that the _petaso_
    can take its place in the dish.

    [7] There is nothing just like this dish in the history
    of gastronomy, considering both the comparatively cheap
    materials and the refinement of the gastronomic idea
    which it embodies. The _chartreuses_ of Carême are the
    nearest thing to it. Lister waxes enthusiastic about it.


[187] INDIAN PEAS
    _PISAM INDICAM_ [1]

COOK PEAS; WHEN SKIMMED, PUT IN THE SAUCE PAN FINELY CHOPPED LEEKS AND
CORIANDER TO BE COOKED [with the peas]. TAKE SMALL CUTTLE FISH, MOST
DESIRABLE BECAUSE OF THE BLACK LIQUOR AND COOK THEM ALSO. ADD OIL,
BROTH AND WINE, A BUNCH OF LEEK AND [green] CORIANDER AND MAKE IT
BOIL. WHEN DONE, CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, ORIGANY, A LITTLE WILD CUMIN
[2] MOISTEN WITH THE JUICE [of the peas] ADD WINE AND RAISIN WINE TO
TASTE; MINCE THE FISH VERY FINE, INCORPORATE IT WITH THE PEAS, AND
SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER [3].

    [1] Tor. _pisum Indicum_.

    [2] Tor., Tac. _casei modicum_; other texts, _carei_.

    [3] The texts continues without interruption to the next
    formula.


[188] ANOTHER WAY
    _ALITER_

COOK THE PEAS, WORK WELL [to make a purée] PLACE IN THE COLD, STIRRING
UNTIL THEY HAVE COOLED OFF. FINELY CHOP ONIONS AND THE WHITES OF HARD
BOILED EGGS, SEASON WITH SALT AND A LITTLE VINEGAR; THE YOLKS PRESS
THROUGH A COLANDER INTO AN ENTRÉE DISH, SEASON WITH FRESH OIL AND
SERVE [1].

    [1] The texts fail to state that the whites, yolks,
    onions, vinegar and oil must eventually be combined into
    a dressing very similar to our own modern _vinaigrette_;
    for decorative and other gastronomic reasons the
    separate treatment of the whites and the yolks is both
    ingenious and excellent, and is very often practised in
    good kitchens today.


[189] PEAS OR BEANS À LA VITELLIUS
    _PISAM VITELLIANAM SIVE FABAM_ [1]

PEAS OR BEANS WITH YOLKS ARE MADE THUS: [2] COOK THE PEAS, SMOOTHEN
[3] THEM; CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, GINGER, AND ON THE CONDIMENTS PUT HARD
BOILED YOLKS, 3 OUNCES OF HONEY, ALSO BROTH, WINE AND VINEGAR; [mix
and] PLACE ALL IN A SAUCE PAN; THE FINELY CHOPPED CONDIMENTS WITH OIL
ADDED, PUT ON THE STOVE TO BE COOKED; WITH THIS FLAVOR THE PEAS WHICH
MUST BE SMOOTH; AND IF THEY BE TOO HARSH [in taste] ADD HONEY AND
SERVE [4].

    [1] List. _Pisa Vitelliana_--named for Vitellius, ninth
    Roman emperor, notorious glutton, according to Hum. who
    says that V. invented this dish: _ab auctore Vitellio
    Imperatore luxui deditissimo_. But Tor. differs; his
    _pisum uitellinum_ stands for peas with
    yolks--_vitellum_--yolk, (also calf) dim. _vitellinum_;
    Tac. _v----am_. Cf. ℞ No. 193.

    [2] Tor. sentence wanting in other texts.

    [3] _lias_--to make a purée by crushing and straining.
    Tor. _lævigabis_, from _levigo_--meaning the same.

    [4] If Vitellius never invented any other dish than this
    one, his gluttony was overrated. As a gastronomer he may
    be safely relegated to the vast multitude of ill-advised
    people whose craving for carbohydrates (which is perhaps
    pathological) causes them to accumulate a surplus of
    fat. This was fatal to Vitellius and his faithful court
    baker who is said to have stuck to his master to the
    last. The poor emperor's _embonpoint_ proved cumbersome
    when he fled the infuriated mob. Had he been leaner he
    might have effected a "getaway." He was dragged through
    the streets and murdered, Dec. 21 or 22, A.D. 69.


[190] ANOTHER WAY
    _ALITER PISAM SIVE FABAM_

[192] A TEMPTING DISH OF PEAS
    _PISAM ADULTERAM _[1]_ VERSATILEM_

THIS ADROIT, TEMPTING DISH OF PEAS IS PREPARED IN THIS MANNER: [2]
COOK PEAS; BRAINS OR SMALL BIRDS, OR BONED THRUSHES, LUCANIAN SAUSAGE,
CHICKEN LIVERS AND GIBLETS--ALL OF WHICH ARE PUT IN A SAUCE PAN;
BROTH, OIL AND A BUNCH OF LEEKS, GREEN CORIANDER FINELY CHOPPED, COOK
WITH THE BRAINS; CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE AND BROTH [3].

    [1] Sch., Dann. crafty, i.e. not genuine. _Adulteram_
    cannot here be used in its most accepted sense, because
    the peas are genuine, and no attempt is made to
    adulterate or "fake" this dish in any way, shape or
    form. Never before have we applied the term "seductive"
    to any dish, but this is just what _adultera_ means.
    "Tempting" of course is quite common.

    [2] Tor. sentence wanting in other texts.

    [3] This formula is incomplete or mutilated, the last
    sentence breaks off in the middle--very likely a
    description of the sauce or condiments belonging to the
    peas.

    Each and every component of this (really tempting) dish
    must be cooked separately; they are then composed in a
    dish, nicely arranged, with the peas in the center,
    surrounded by the several morsels, with an appropriate
    gravy made from the natural liquor or juices of the
    component parts poured over the dish.

[195] PEAS IN THE POD APICIAN STYLE
    _CONCHICLAM APICIANAM_

FOR PEAS IN THE POD [1] APICIAN STYLE TAKE: [2] A CLEAN EARTHEN POT IN
WHICH TO COOK THE PEAS; TO THE PEAS ADD FINELY CUT LUCANIAN SAUSAGE,
LITTLE PORK CAKES [3], PIECES OF MEAT [4] AND PORK SHOULDER [5]. CRUSH
PEPPER, LOVAGE, ORIGANY, DILL, DRY ONIONS [6] GREEN CORIANDER
MOISTENED WITH BROTH, WINE, AND ADD [more] BROTH TO TASTE; UNITE THIS
WITH THE PEAS IN THE EARTHEN POT TO WHICH ADD OIL IN SUFFICIENT
QUANTITY TO BE ABSORBED BY THE PEAS; FINISH ON A SLOW FIRE TO GIVE IT
LIVE HEAT AND SERVE.

    [1] Peas in the pod are likewise called _conchicla_;
    hence perhaps any legumes cooked in the shells.

    _CONCHICLA DE PISA SIMPLICI_ [1]

COOK THE PEAS [in the pods] WHEN SKIMMED ADD A BUNCH [2] OF LEEKS AND
GREEN CORIANDER. WHILE BEING COOKED CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, ORIGANY, AND
[the above] BUNCH [of herbs] [3] MOISTEN WITH ITS OWN JUICE, WINE [4]
ENOUGH TO SUIT YOUR TASTE, THEN ADD OIL AND FINISH ON A SLOW FIRE [5].

    _CONCHICLA COMMODIANA_

MAKE PEAS COMMODIAN STYLE THUS: [2] COOK THE PEAS, WHEN SKIMMED, CRUSH

[198] ANOTHER STYLE
    _ALITER CONCHICLAM SIC FACIES_ [1]

CUT [raw] CHICKEN INTO SMALL PIECES, ADD BROTH, OIL AND WINE, AND STEW
IT. CHOP ONIONS AND CORIANDER FINE AND ADD BRAINS [calf's or pork,
parboiled] THE SKIN AND NERVES REMOVED, TO THE CHICKEN. WHEN THIS IS
COOKED TAKE [the chicken] OUT AND BONE IT. THE PEAS COOK SEPARATELY,
WITHOUT SEASONING, ONLY USING CHOPPED ONIONS AND CORIANDER AND THE
BROTH OF THE CHICKEN; STRAIN [part of] THE PEAS AND ARRANGE THEM
ALTERNATELY [in a dish with the pieces of chicken, brains and the
unstrained peas] THEN CRUSH PEPPER AND CUMIN, MOISTENED WITH CHICKEN
BROTH. IN THE MORTAR BEAT 2 EGGS WITH BROTH TO TASTE, POUR THIS OVER
THE CHICKEN AND PEAS, FINISH ON A SLOW FIRE [1], DISH OUT ON A HEAP OF
PEAS, GARNISH WITH PINE NUTS AND SERVE.

    [1] By congealing in a mould, which is unmoulded on a
    heap of peas. Danneil directs to stuff the whole chicken
    with the pea preparation, brains, etc., and to poach it
    in a square pan.

CRUSH WELL WASHED BARLEY, SOAKED THE DAY BEFORE, PLACE ON THE FIRE TO
BE COOKED. WHEN HOT ADD PLENTY OIL, A SMALL BUNCH OF DILL, DRY ONION,
SATURY AND COLOCASIUM, TO BE COOKED TOGETHER BECAUSE THIS GIVES A
BETTER JUICE; ADD GREEN CORIANDER AND A LITTLE SALT; BRING IT TO A

    warm baths; a favorite resort of the Romans.

    [2] Wanting in Tor.

    [3] These apparently outlandish ways of cooking beans
    compel us to draw a modern parallel in a cookery book,
    specializing in Jewish dishes. To prove that Apicius is
    not dead "by a long shot," we shall quote from Wolf,
    Rebekka: Kochbuch für Israelitische Frauen, Frankfurt,
    1896, 11th edition. As a matter of fact, Rebekka Wolf is
    outdoing Apicius in strangeness--a case of _Apicium in
    ipso Apicio_, as Lister sarcastically remarks of
    Torinus.

    Rebekka Wolf: ℞ No. 211--wash and boil the young
    beans in fat _bouillon_ (Apicius: _oleum et liquamen_)
    adding a handful of chopped pepperwort (A.: _piper,
    ligusticum_) and later chopped parsley (A.:
    _petroselinum_) some sugar (A.: _mel pavo_--little
    honey) and pepper. Beans later in the season are cooked
    with potatoes. The young beans are tied with flour
    dissolved in water, or with roux.

    _Id. ibid._, ℞ No. 212, Beans Sweet-Sour. Boil in
    water, fat, salt, add vinegar, sugar or syrup, "English
    aromatics" and spices, lemon peel, and a little pepper;
    bind with roux.

    _Id. ibid._, ℞ No. 213, Cut Pickled Beans
    (_Schneidebohnen_) prepare as ℞ No. 212, but if you
    would have them more delicious, take instead of the roux
    grated chocolate, sugar, cinnamon, lemon peel and lemon
    juice, and some claret. If not sour enough, add vinegar,
    but right here you must add more fat; you may lay on top
    of this dish a bouquet of sliced apples.

    _Id. ibid._, ℞ No. 214, Beans and Pears. Take cut and
    pickled beans and prepare as above. To this add peeled
    fresh pears, cut into quarters; then sugar, lemon peel
    cut thin, cinnamon, "English" mixed spices, and at last
    the roux, thinned with broth. This dish must be sweet
    and very fat.

    As for exotic combinations, Apicius surely survives

[Beans or chick-peas] ARE COOKED IN A WINE SAUCE AND SEASONED WITH
PEPPER [1].

AND COOK THE BEANS, IN A RICH MANNER, REMOVE THE SEEDS AND SERVE [as a
Salad [2]], WITH HARD EGGS, GREEN FENNEL, PEPPER, BROTH, A LITTLE
REDUCED WINE AND A LITTLE SALT, OR SERVE THEM IN SIMPLER WAYS, AS YOU
MAY SEE FIT.

    [1] The original continues with the preceding formula.

    [2] For a salad we would add finely chopped onion,
    pepper, and some lemon juice.

    The purpose of removing the seeds is obscure. G.-V.
    reads _semine cum ovis_; Tac. _semie_; Hum. _s. cum
    lobis_. The passage may mean to sprinkle (sow) with hard
    boiled (and finely chopped) eggs, which is often done on
    a salad and other dishes.

Found at Hildesheim in 1868. This and a number of other pieces form
the collection known as The Hildesheim Treasure, now at the Kaiser
Friedrich Museum, Berlin.

This wine crater is entirely of silver, a piece of supreme workmanship
of Roman origin. Very delicate decoration, anticipating the
Renaissance: Winged griffins and other monsters, half ox, half lion,
at the base; aquatic animals, genii angling and spearing fish.

There is a second vessel inside, acting as a liner, to take the weight
of the fluid off the decorated bowl. The complete weight is 9451.8
gr., but the inner liner is stamped CVM BASI PONDO XXXXI--41 pounds
with the base. The weight of silver pieces was inscribed as a check on
the slaves.

The bowl is 0.36 meter (about 14-1/4 inches) in height and 0.353 meter
in diameter. It stands on the tripod which is depicted separately.}

BOIL THIS IN THE STOCK KETTLE [with the ostrich, remove the bird when
done, strain the liquid] THICKEN WITH ROUX. [To this sauce] ADD THE
OSTRICH MEAT CUT IN CONVENIENT PIECES, SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER. IF YOU

CRANE, DUCK, PARTRIDGE, DOVE, WOOD PIGEON, SQUAB, AND DIVERS BIRDS
  _IN GRUE VEL ANATE PERDICE TURTURE PALUMBO COLUMBO ET DIVERSIS AVIBUS_


[212] CRANE OR DUCK
    _GRUEM VEL ANATEM_

WASH [the fowl] AND DRESS IT NICELY [1] PUT IN A STEW POT, ADD WATER,
SALT AND DILL, PARBOIL [2] SO AS TO HAVE THEM HALF DONE, UNTIL THE
MEAT IS HARD, REMOVE THEM, PUT THEM IN A SAUCE PAN [to be finished by
braising] WITH OIL, BROTH, A BUNCH OF ORIGANY AND CORIANDER; WHEN
NEARLY DONE, ADD A LITTLE REDUCED MUST, TO GIVE IT COLOR. MEANWHILE
CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, CUMIN, CORIANDER, LASER ROOT, RUE [moistened
with] REDUCED WINE AND SOME HONEY, ADD SOME OF THE FOWL BROTH [3] TO
IT AND VINEGAR TO TASTE; EMPTY [the sauce] INTO A SAUCE PAN, HEAT,
BIND WITH ROUX, AND [strain] THE SAUCE OVER THE FOWL IN AN ENTRÉE
DISH.

    [1] _Lavas et ornas_, i.e., singe, empty carcass of
    intestines, truss or bind it to keep its shape during
    coction, and, usually, lard it with either strips or
    slices of fat pork and stuff the carcass with greens,
    celery leaves, etc.

    [2] _Dimidia coctura decoques._ Apicius here pursues the
    right course for the removable of any disagreeable taste
    often adhering to aquatic fowl, feeding on fish or food
    found in the water, by parboiling the meat. Cf. ℞ No.
    214.

    [3] Again, as so often: _ius de suo sibi_; here the
    liquor of the braising pan, for stock in which the fowl
    is parboiled cannot be used for reasons set forth in
    Note 2.


[213] ANOTHER WAY OF COOKING CRANE, DUCK OR CHICKEN
    _ALITER IN GRUE [VEL] IN ANATE VEL IN PULLO_

PEPPER, SHALLOTS, LOVAGE, CUMIN, CELERY SEED, PRUNES OR DAMASCUS PLUMS
STONES REMOVED, FRESH MUST, VINEGAR [1] BROTH, REDUCED MUST AND OIL.
BOIL THE CRANE; WHILE COOKING IT TAKE CARE THAT ITS HEAD IS NOT
TOUCHED BY THE WATER BUT THAT IT REMAINS WITHOUT. WHEN THE CRANE IS
DONE, WRAP IT IN A HOT TOWEL, AND PULL THE HEAD OFF SO THAT THE SINEWS
FOLLOW IN A MANNER THAT THE MEAT AND THE BONES REMAIN; FOR ONE CANNOT
ENJOY THE HARD SINEWS [2].

    [1] Dann. mead.

    [2] Remarkable ingenuity! Try this on your turkey legs.
    Danneil is of the opinion that the head and its feathers
    were to be saved for decorative purposes, in style
    during the middle ages when game bird patties were
    decorated with the fowl's plumage, a custom which
    survived to Danneil's time (ca. 1900). But this is not
    likely to be the case here, for it would be a simple
    matter to skin the bird before cooking it in order to
    save the plumage for the taxidermist.


[214] CRANE OR DUCK WITH TURNIPS
    _GRUEM VEL ANATEM EX RAPIS_ [1]

TAKE OUT [remove entrails, [2]] CLEAN WASH AND DRESS [the bird] AND
PARBOIL [2] IT IN WATER WITH SALT AND DILL. NEXT PREPARE TURNIPS AND
COOK THEM IN WATER WHICH IS TO BE SQUEEZED OUT [3]. TAKE THEM OUT OF
THE POT AND WASH THEM AGAIN [4]. AND PUT INTO A SAUCE PAN THE DUCK
WITH OIL, BROTH, A BUNCH OF LEEKS AND CORIANDER; THE TURNIPS CUT INTO
SMALL PIECES; THESE PUT ON TOP OF THE [duck] IN ORDER TO FINISH
COOKING. WHEN HALF DONE, TO GIVE IT COLOR, ADD REDUCED MUST. THE SAUCE
IS PREPARED SEPARATELY: PEPPER, CUMIN, CORIANDER, LASER ROOT MOISTENED
WITH VINEGAR AND DILUTED WITH ITS OWN BROTH [of the fowl]; BRING THIS
TO A BOILING POINT, THICKEN WITH ROUX. [In a deep dish arrange the
duck] ON TOP OF THE TURNIPS [strain the sauce over it] SPRINKLE WITH
PEPPER AND SERVE.

    [1] Duck and Turnips, a dish much esteemed on the
    Continent today. Only few prepare it correctly as does
    Old Apicius; hence it is not popular with the multitude.

    [2] Tac., Tor. _excipies_; Hum. _legendum: ex rapis_.

    [3] G.-V. _ut exbromari possint_; Tor. _expromi_; Hum.
    _expromari_; all of which does not mean anything. To
    cook the turnips so that they can be squeezed out
    (_exprimo_, from _ex_ and _premo_) is the proper thing
    to do from a culinary standpoint.

    [4] The turnips are cooked half, the water removed, and
    finished with the duck, as prescribed by Apicius. It is
    really admirable to see how he handles these food
    materials in order to remove any disagreeable flavor,
    which may be the case both with the turnips (the small
    white variety) and the duck. Such careful treatment is
    little known nowadays even in the best kitchens. Cf.
    Note 2 to ℞ No. 212.

[229] TREATMENT OF STRONG SMELLING BIRDS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION
    _AD AVES HIRCOSAS _[1]_ OMNI GENERE_

FOR BIRDS OF ALL KINDS THAT HAVE A GOATISH [1] SMELL [2] PEPPER,
LOVAGE, THYME, DRY MINT, SAGE, DATES, HONEY, VINEGAR, WINE, BROTH,
OIL, REDUCED MUST, MUSTARD. THE BIRDS WILL BE MORE LUSCIOUS AND
NUTRITIOUS, AND THE FAT PRESERVED, IF YOU ENVELOP THEM IN A DOUGH OF
FLOUR AND OIL AND BAKE THEM IN THE OVEN [3].

    [1] Probably game birds in an advanced stage of "_haut
    goût_" (as the Germans use the antiquated French term),
    or "_mortification_" as the French cook says. Possibly
    also such birds as crows, black birds, buzzards, etc.,
    and fish-feeding fowl. Moreover, it must be borne in
    mind that the refrigeration facilities of the ancients
    were not too good and that fresh goods spoiled quickly.
    Hence, perhaps, excessive seasoning, at least, as
    compared to our modern methods.

    List. _aves piscivoras_; Hum. thinks the birds to be
    downright spoiled: _olidas, rancidas, & grave olentes_.

    [2] Tor. Sentence wanting in other texts.

    [3] For birds with a goatish smell Apicius should have
    repeated his excellent formula in ℞ No. 212, the
    method of parboiling the birds before final coction, if,
    indeed, one cannot dispense with such birds altogether.
    The above recipe does not in the least indicate how to
    treat smelly birds. Wrapping them in dough would vastly
    increase the ill-savour.

    As for game birds, we agree with most connoisseurs that
    they should have just a suspicion of "_haut goût_"--a
    condition of advanced mellowness after the _rigor
    mortis_ has disappeared.


[230] ANOTHER TREATMENT OF ODOR
    _ALIUD CONTRA UIROSUM ODOREM_ [1]

[IF THE BIRDS SMELL, [1]] STUFF THE INSIDE WITH CRUSHED FRESH OLIVES,
SEW UP [the aperture] AND THUS COOK, THEN RETIRE THE COOKED OLIVES.

    [1] Tor.; other texts _aliter avem_, i.e. that the olive
    treatment is not necessarily confined to ill smelling
    birds alone.



VI


[231] FOR FLAMINGO [and Parrot]
    _IN PHŒNICOPTERO_

SCALD [1] THE FLAMINGO, WASH AND DRESS IT, PUT IT IN A POT, ADD WATER,
SALT, DILL, AND A LITTLE VINEGAR, TO BE PARBOILED. FINISH COOKING WITH
A BUNCH OF LEEKS AND CORIANDER, AND ADD SOME REDUCED MUST TO GIVE IT
COLOR. IN THE MORTAR CRUSH PEPPER, CUMIN, CORIANDER, LASER ROOT, MINT,
RUE, MOISTEN WITH VINEGAR, ADD DATES, AND THE FOND OF THE BRAISED
BIRD, THICKEN, [strain] COVER THE BIRD WITH THE SAUCE AND SERVE.
PARROT IS PREPARED IN THE SAME MANNER.

    [1] Prior to removing the feathers; also singe the fine
    feathers and hair.


[232] ANOTHER WAY
    _ALITER_

ROAST THE BIRD. CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, CELERY SEED, SESAM [1] PARSLEY,
MINT, SHALLOTS, DATES, HONEY, WINE, BROTH, VINEGAR, OIL, REDUCED MUST
TO TASTE.

    [1] Tor. _sesamum, defrutum_; G.-V. _s. frictum_.



VII


[233] TO PREVENT BIRDS FROM SPOILING
    _AVES OMNES NE LIQUESCANT_

SCALDED WITH THE FEATHERS BIRDS WILL NOT ALWAYS BE JUICY; IT IS BETTER
TO FIRST EMPTY THEM THROUGH THE NECK AND STEAM THEM SUSPENDED OVER A
KETTLE WITH WATER [1].

    [1] Dry picking is of course the best method. Apicius is
    trying to overcome the evils of scalding fowl with the
    feathers. This formula is mutilated; the various texts
    differ considerably.



VIII

[FOR GOOSE]
  [_IN ANSERE_]


[234] BOILED GOOSE WITH COLD APICIAN SAUCE
    _ANSEREM ELIXUM EX IURE APICIANO FRIGIDO_

CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, CORIANDER SEED [1] MINT, RUE, MOISTEN WITH BROTH
AND A MODERATE AMOUNT OF OIL. TAKE THE COOKED GOOSE OUT OF THE POT AND
WHILE HOT WIPE IT CLEAN WITH A TOWEL, POUR THE SAUCE OVER IT AND
SERVE.

    [1] G.-V.; Tor. (fresh) coriander, more suited for a
    cold sauce.



IX

[FOR CHICKEN]
  [_IN PULLO_]


[235] RAW SAUCE FOR BOILED CHICKEN
    _IN PULLO ELIXO IUS CRUDUM_

PUT IN THE MORTAR DILL SEED, DRY MINT, LASER ROOT, MOISTEN WITH
VINEGAR, FIG WINE, BROTH, A LITTLE MUSTARD, OIL AND REDUCED MUST, AND
SERVE [1] [Known as] DILL CHICKEN [2].

    [1] This and the preceding cold dressings are more or
    less variations of our modern cold dressings that are
    used for cold dishes of all kinds, especially salads.

    [2] Tor. heads the following formula _præparatio pulli
    anethi_--chicken in dill sauce, which is the correct
    description of the above formula. Tac., G.-V. also
    commence the next with _pullum anethatum_, which is not
    correct, as the following recipe contains no dill.


[236] ANOTHER CHICKEN
    _ALITER PULLUS_ [1]

A LITTLE HONEY IS MIXED WITH BROTH; THE COOKED [parboiled] CHICKEN IS
CLEANED [skin taken off, sinews, etc., removed] THE CARCASS DRIED WITH
A TOWEL, QUARTERED, THE PIECES IMMERSED IN BROTH [2] SO THAT THE
SAVOUR PENETRATES THOROUGHLY. FRY THE PIECES [in the pan] POUR OVER
THEIR OWN GRAVY, SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER, SERVE.

    [1] Hum., List. cf. Note 2 to ℞ No. 235.

    [2] Marinated; but the nature of this marinade is not
    quite clear; a spicy marinade of wine and herbs and
    spices would be appropriate for certain game birds, but
    chicken ordinarily requires no marinade except some oil
    before frying. It is possible that Apicius left the
    cooked chicken in the broth to prevent it from drying
    out, which is good.


[237] CHICKEN PARTHIAN STYLE
    _PULLUM PARTHICUM_ [1]

DRESS THE CHICKEN CAREFULLY [2] AND QUARTER IT. CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE
AND A LITTLE CARRAWAY [3] MOISTENED WITH BROTH, AND ADD WINE TO TASTE.
[After frying] PLACE THE CHICKEN IN AN EARTHEN DISH [4] POUR THE
SEASONING OVER IT, ADD LASER AND WINE [5] LET IT ASSIMILATE WITH THE
SEASONING AND BRAISE THE CHICKEN TO A POINT. WHEN DONE SPRINKLE WITH
PEPPER AND SERVE.

    [1] Lister is of the opinion that the _pullus Parthicus_
    is a kind of chicken that came originally from Asia,
    Parthia being a country of Asia, the present Persia or
    northern India, a chicken of small size with feathers on
    its feet, i.e., a bantam.

    [2] Pluck, singe, empty, wash, trim. The texts: _a
    navi_. Hum. _hoc est, à parte posteriore ventris, qui ut
    navis cavus & figuræ ejus non dissimile est_. Dann.
    takes this literally, but _navo_ (_navus_) here simply
    means "to perform diligently."

    [3] Tor. _casei modicum_; List. _carei_--more likely
    than cheese.

    [4] _Cumana_--an earthenware casserole, excellent for
    that purpose.

    [5] G.-V. _laser [et] vivum_.


[238] CHICKEN SOUR
    _PULLUM OXYZOMUM_

A GOOD-SIZED GLASS OF OIL, A SMALLER GLASS OF BROTH, AND THE SMALLEST
MEASURE OF VINEGAR, 6 SCRUPLES OF PEPPER, PARSLEY AND A BUNCH OF
LEEKS.

    G.-V. _[laseris] satis modice_.

    These directions are very vague. If the raw chicken is
    quartered, fried in the oil, and then braised in the
    broth with a dash of vinegar, the bunch of leeks and
    parsley, seasoned with pepper and a little salt, we have
    a dish gastronomically correct. The leeks may be served
    as a garnish, the gravy, properly reduced and strained
    over the chicken which like in the previous formula is
    served in a casserole.


[239] GUINEA HEN

MOISTENED WITH VINEGAR, HONEY, BROTH AND OIL TO TASTE [3] WHEN BOILING
THICKEN WITH ROUX [strain] POUR OVER THE CHICKEN, SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER
AND SERVE.

    [1] _Curas._

    [2] Remove skin, tissues, bones, etc., cut in pieces
    and marinate in the pickle.

    [3] Immerse the chicken pieces in this sauce and braise
    them to a point.


[240] CHICKEN WITH LASER
    _PULLUM LASERATUM_

DRESS THE CHICKEN CAREFULLY [1] CLEAN, GARNISH [2] AND PLACE IN AN
EARTHEN CASSEROLE. CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, LASER MOISTENED WITH WINE [3]
ADD BROTH AND WINE TO TASTE, AND PUT THIS ON THE FIRE; WHEN DONE SERVE
WITH PEPPER SPRINKLED OVER.

    [1] _a navi._ cf. Note 2 to ℞ No. 237.

    [2] G.-V. _lavabis_, _ornabis_, with vegetables, etc.

    [3] G.-V. _laser vivum_.


[241] ROAST CHICKEN
    _PULLUM PAROPTUM_

A LITTLE LASER, 6 SCRUPLES OF PEPPER, A GLASS OF OIL, A GLASS OF
BROTH, AND A LITTLE PARSLEY.

    [1] _Paropsis_, _parapsis_, from the Greek, a platter,
    dish.

    A most incomplete formula. It does not state whether the
    ingredients are to be added to the sauce or the
    dressing. We have an idea that the chicken is pickled in
    this solution before roasting and that the pickle is
    used in making the gravy.


[242] BOILED CHICKEN IN ITS OWN BROTH
    _PULLUM ELIXUM EX IURE SUO_

CRUSH PEPPER, CUMIN, A LITTLE THYME, FENNEL SEED, MINT, RUE, LASER
ROOT, MOISTENED WITH VINEGAR, ADD FIG DATES [1] WORK WELL AND MAKE IT
SAVORY WITH HONEY, VINEGAR, BROTH AND OIL TO TASTE: THE BOILED CHICKEN
PROPERLY CLEANED AND DRIED [with the towel] IS MASKED WITH THIS SAUCE
[2].

    [1] Goll. cloves--_cariophyllus_; the originals have
    _caryotam_ and _careotam_.

    [2] Apparently another cold sauce of the vinaigrette
    type similar to ℞ No. 235.


[243] CHICKEN AND PUMPKIN
    _PULLUM ELIXUM CUM CUCURBITIS ELIXIS_

TO THE ABOVE DESCRIBED DRESSING ADD MUSTARD, POUR OVER [1] AND SERVE.

    [1] G.-V. _Perfundes_; Tor. _piper fundes_.

    The pumpkin, not mentioned here, is likewise served cold
    boiled, seasoned with the same dressing. It is perhaps
    used for stuffing the chicken and cooked simultaneously
    with the same.


[244] CHICKEN AND DASHEENS [1]
    _PULLUM ELIXUM CUM COLOCASIIS ELIXIS_

THE ABOVE SAUCE IS ALSO USED FOR THIS DISH. STUFF THE CHICKEN WITH
[peeled] DASHEENS AND [stoned] GREEN OLIVES, THOUGH NOT TOO MUCH SO
THAT THE DRESSING MAY HAVE ROOM FOR EXPANSION, TO PREVENT BURSTING
WHILE THE CHICKEN IS BEING COOKED IN THE POT. HOLD IT DOWN WITH A
SMALL BASKET, LIFT IT UP FREQUENTLY [2] AND HANDLE CAREFULLY SO THAT
THE CHICKEN DOES NOT BURST [3].

    [1] Dasheens are the equivalent of the ancient
    colocasium; at least they are very close relatives. Cf.
    Notes to ℞ Nos. 74, 216, 244, 322.

    [2] For inspection. G.-V. _levas_; Tor. _lavabis_, for
    which there is no reason.

    [3] Dann. and Goll., not knowing the colocasium or
    dasheen have entirely erroneous versions of this
    formula. The dasheen is well adapted for the stuffing of
    fowl. Ordinarily the dasheen is boiled or steamed,
    mashed, seasoned and then stuffed inside of a raw
    chicken which is then roasted. Being very starchy, the
    dasheen readily absorbs the fats and juices of the
    roast, making a delicious dressing, akin in taste to a
    combined potato and chestnut purée.

    As the above chicken is cooked in _bouillon_ or water,
    the dasheen may be used in a raw state for filling. We
    have tried this method. Instead of confining the chicken
    in a basket, we have tied it in a napkin and boiled
    slowly until done. Serve cold, with the above dressing.


[245] CHICKEN À LA VARUS [1]
    _PULLUS VARDANUS_

COOK THE CHICKEN IN THIS STOCK: BROTH, OIL, WINE, A BUNCH OF LEEKS,
CORIANDER, SATURY; WHEN DONE, CRUSH PEPPER, NUTS WITH 2 GLASSES OF
WATER [2] AND THE JUICE OF THE CHICKEN. RETIRE THE BUNCHES OF GREENS,
ADD MILK TO TASTE. THE THINGS CRUSHED IN THE MORTAR ADD TO THE CHICKEN
AND COOK IT TOGETHER: THICKEN THE SAUCE WITH BEATEN WHITES OF EGG [3]
AND POUR THE SAUCE OVER THE CHICKEN. THIS IS CALLED "WHITE SAUCE."

    [1] G.-V. _Vardanus_; Tor. _Vardamus_; Hum. _Vardanus
    legendum, puto, Varianus, portentuosæ luxuriæ
    Imperator_. Hum. thinks the dish is dedicated to emperor
    Varianus (?) The word may also be the adjective of
    Varus, Quintilius V., commander of colonial armies and
    glutton, under Augustus. Varus committed suicide after
    his defeat in the Teutoburg Forest by the Germans.

    [2] G.-V. broth, own stock--_ius de suo sibi_.

    [3] Strain, avoid ebullition after the eggs have been
    added. Most unusual _liaison_; usually the yolks are
    used for this purpose. The whites are consistent with
    the name of the sauce.


[246] CHICKEN À LA FRONTO [1]
    _PULLUM FRONTONIANUM_

A HALF-COOKED CHICKEN MARINADED IN A PICKLE OF BROTH, MIXED WITH OIL,
TO WHICH IS ADDED A BUNCH OF DILL, LEEKS, SATURY AND GREEN CORIANDER.
FINISH IT IN THIS BROTH. WHEN DONE, TAKE THE CHICKEN OUT [2] DRESS IT
NICELY ON A DISH, POUR OVER THE [sauce, colored with] REDUCED MUST,
SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.

    [1] Named for a Roman by the name of Fronto. There is a
    sucking pig à la Fronto, too. Cf. ℞ No. 374. M.
    Cornelius Fronto was orator and author during the reign
    of Emperor Hadrian. According to Dann. a certain
    Frontone under Emperor Severus.

    [2] List., G.-V. _levabis_; Tor. _lavabis_, for which
    there is little or no occasion. He may mean to clean,
    i.e. remove skin, tissues, sinews, small bones, etc.


[247] CREAMED CHICKEN WITH PASTE [1]
    _PULLUS TRACTOGALATUS_ [2]

COOK THE CHICKEN [as follows, in] BROTH, OIL, WITH WINE ADDED, TO
WHICH ADD A BUNCH OF CORIANDER AND [green] ONIONS. WHEN DONE TAKE IT
OUT [3] [strain and save] THE BROTH, AND PUT IT IN A NEW SAUCE PAN,
ADD MILK AND A LITTLE SALT, HONEY AND A PINT [4] OF WATER, THAT IS, A
THIRD PART: PLACE IT BACK ON A SLOW FIRE TO SIMMER. FINALLY BREAK [the
paste, [1]] PUT IT LITTLE BY LITTLE INTO [the boiling broth] STIRRING
WELL SO IT WILL NOT BURN. PUT THE CHICKEN IN, EITHER WHOLE OR IN
PIECES [5] DISH IT OUT IN A DEEP DISH. THIS COVER WITH THE FOLLOWING
SAUCE [6] PEPPER, LOVAGE, ORIGANY, MOISTENED WITH HONEY AND A LITTLE
REDUCED MUST. ADD SOME OF THE [chicken] BROTH, HEAT IN A SMALL SAUCE
PAN AND WHEN IT BOILS THICKEN WITH ROUX [7] AND SERVE.

    [1] Spätzle, noodles, macaroni; this dish is the ancient
    "Chicken Tetrazzini." Dann. Chicken pie or patty.

    [2] _tractum_ and _gala_, prepared with paste and milk.
    Cf. _tractomelitus_, from _tractum_ and _meli_, paste
    and honey.

    [3] Cf. Note 2 to ℞ Nos. 244 and 246.

    [4] List. _minimum_; Tor. _heminam_; Sch. _eminam_. See
    Measures. The noodle paste should be cooked separately
    in the water.

    [5] List. _vel carptum_, which is correct. Tor. _vel
    careotam_, out of place here.

    [6] This sauce seems to be superfluous. Very likely it
    is a separate formula for a sauce of some kind.

    [7] Seems superfluous, too. The noodle paste in the
    chicken gravy makes it sufficiently thick.


[248] STUFFED CHICKEN [OR PIG]
    _PULLUS FARSILIS_ [1]

EMPTY THE CHICKEN THROUGH THE APERTURE OF THE NECK SO THAT NONE OF THE
ENTRAILS REMAIN. CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, GINGER, CUT MEAT [2] COOKED
SPELT, BESIDES CRUSH BRAINS COOKED IN THE [chicken] BROTH, BREAK EGGS
AND MIX ALL TOGETHER IN ORDER TO MAKE A SOLID DRESSING; ADD BROTH TO
TASTE AND A LITTLE OIL, WHOLE PEPPER, PLENTY OF NUTS. WITH THIS
DRESSING STUFF EITHER A CHICKEN OR A SUCKLING PIG, LEAVING ENOUGH ROOM
FOR EXPANSION [3].

    [1] Tor. _fusilis_.

    [2] Preferably raw pork or veal.

    [3] A most sumptuous dressing; it compares favorably
    with our popular stale bread pap usually called "chicken
    dressing."


[249] STUFFED CAPON LIKEWISE
    _SIMILITER IN CAPO FACIES_ [1]

THE CAPON IS STUFFED IN A SIMILAR WAY BUT IS COOKED WITH ALL THE BONES
REMOVED [2].

    [1] Sch. _in capso_. May be interpreted thus: Cooked in
    an envelope of caul or linen, in which case it would
    correspond to our modern galantine of chicken.

    [2] Tor. _ossibus eiectis_; Hum. _omnibus e._; i.e. all
    the entrails, etc., which is not correct. The bones must
    be removed from the capon in this case.


[250] CHICKEN AND CREAM SAUCE [1]
    _PULLUS LEUCOZOMUS_ [2]

TAKE A CHICKEN AND PREPARE IT AS ABOVE. EMPTY IT THROUGH THE APERTURE
OF THE NECK SO THAT NONE OF THE ENTRAILS REMAIN. TAKE [a little] WATER
[3] AND PLENTY OF SPANISH OIL, STIR, COOK TOGETHER UNTIL ALL MOISTURE
IS EVAPORATED [4] WHEN THIS IS DONE TAKE THE CHICKEN OUT, SO THAT THE
GREATEST POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF OIL REMAINS BEHIND [5] SPRINKLE WITH
PEPPER AND SERVE [6].

    [1] The ancient version of Chicken à la Maryland, Wiener
    Backhähndl, etc.

    [2] Tor. _Leocozymus_; from the Greek _leucozomos_,
    prepared with white sauce. The formula for the cream
    sauce is lacking here. Cf. ℞ No. 245.

    [3] The use of water to clarify the oil which is to
    serve as a deep frying fat is an ingenious idea, little
    practised today. It surely saves the fat or oil,
    prevents premature burning or blackening by frequent
    use, and gives a better tasting _friture_. The above
    recipe is a mere fragment, but even this reveals the
    extraordinary knowledge of culinary principles of
    Apicius who reveals himself to us as a master of
    well-understood principles of good cookery that are so
    often ignored today. Cf. Note 5 to ℞ No. 497.

    [4] The recipe fails to state that the chicken must be
    breaded, or that the pieces of chicken be turned in
    flour, etc., and fried in the oil.

    [5] Another vital rule of deep fat frying not stated, or
    rather stated in the language of the kitchen, namely
    that the chicken must be crisp, dry, that is, not
    saturated with oil, which of course every good fry cook
    knows.

    [6] With the cream sauce, prepared separately, spread on
    the platter, with the fried chicken inside, or the sauce
    in a separate dish, we have here a very close
    resemblance to a very popular modern dish.

I

SOW'S WOMB, CRACKLINGS, UDDER, TENDERLOIN, TAILS AND FEET
  _VULVÆ STERILES, CALLUM LUMBELLI COTICULÆ ET UNGELLÆ_


[251] SPAYED SOW'S WOMB [1]
    _VULVÆ STERILES_

STERILE SOW'S WOMB (ALSO UDDER AND BELLY) IS PREPARED IN THIS MANNER:
TAKE [2] LASER FROM CYRENE OR PARTHIA, VINEGAR AND BROTH.

    [1] The vulva of a sow was a favorite dish with the
    ancients, considered a great delicacy. Sows were
    slaughtered before they had a litter, or were spayed for
    the purpose of obtaining the sterile womb.

    [2] Tor. sentence wanting in other texts.


[252] ANOTHER WAY
    _ALITER_

TAKE PEPPER, CELERY SEED, DRY MINT, LASER ROOT, HONEY, VINEGAR AND
BROTH.


[253] SPAYED SOW'S WOMB
    _VULVÆ STERILES_

WITH PEPPER, BROTH AND PARTHIAN LASER.


[254] ANOTHER WAY
    _ALITER_

WITH PEPPER, LOVAGE [1] AND BROTH AND A LITTLE CONDIMENT.

    [1] Wanting in Lister.


[255] CRACKLINGS, PORK SKIN, TENDERLOIN, TAILS AND FEET
    _CALLUM, LUMBELLI _[1]_ COTICULÆ, UNGELLÆ_

SERVE WITH PEPPER, BROTH AND LASER (WHICH THE GREEKS CALL "SILPHION")
[2].

    [1] Tor., G.-V. _libelli_.

    [2] Tor. sentence wanting in other texts.


[256] GRILLED SOW'S WOMB
    _VULVAM UT TOSTAM FACIAS_

ENVELOPE IN BRAN, AFTERWARDS [1] PUT IN BRINE AND THEN COOK IT.

    [1] We would reverse the process: first pickle the
    vulva, then coat it with bran (or with bread crumbs) and
    fry.



II


[257] SOW'S BELLY
    _SUMEN_

SOW'S UDDER OR BELLY WITH THE PAPS ON IT IS PREPARED IN THIS MANNER
[1] THE BELLY BOIL, TIE IT TOGETHER WITH REEDS, SPRINKLE WITH SALT AND
PLACE IT IN THE OVEN, OR, START ROASTING ON THE GRIDIRON. CRUSH
PEPPER, LOVAGE, WITH BROTH, PURE WINE, ADDING RAISIN WINE TO TASTE,
THICKEN [the sauce] WITH ROUX AND POUR IT OVER THE ROAST.

    [1] Tor. sentence wanting in other texts.


[258] STUFFED SOW'S BELLY
    _SUMEN PLENUM_

FULL [1] SOW'S BELLY IS STUFFED WITH [2] CRUSHED PEPPER, CARRAWAY,
SALT MUSSELS; SEW THE BELLY TIGHT AND ROAST. ENJOY THIS WITH A BRINE
SAUCE AND MUSTARD.

    [1] Full grown, also stuffed with forcemeat.

FIG-FED PORK
  _FICATUM_ [1]

    [1] Tor. _De Sycoto, id est, Ficato_.


[259] WINE SAUCE FOR FIG-FED PORK
    _IN FICATO ŒNOGARUM_ [1]

FIG-FED PORK LIVER (THAT IS, LIVER CRAMMED WITH FIGS) IS PREPARED IN A
WINE SAUCE WITH [2] PEPPER, THYME, LOVAGE, BROTH, A LITTLE WINE AND
OIL [3].

    [1] Tor. _Ficatum, iecur suillum_.

    [2] Tor. sentence wanting in other texts.

    [3] Reinsenius, _ficatum_ [_or sicatum_] _projecore_.

    According to the invention of Marcus Apicius, pigs were
    starved, and the hungry pigs were crammed with dry figs
    and then suddenly given all the mead they wanted to
    drink. The violent expansion of the figs in the
    stomachs, or the fermentation caused acute indigestion
    which killed the pigs. The livers were very much
    enlarged, similar to the cramming of geese for the sake
    of obtaining abnormally large livers. This latter method
    prevailed in the Strassburg District until recently when
    it was prohibited by law.


[260] ANOTHER WAY
    _ALITER_

TRIM [the liver] MARINATE IN BROTH, WITH PEPPER, LOVAGE, TWO LAUREL
BERRIES, WRAP IN CAUL, GRILL ON THE GRIDIRON AND SERVE.

    Goll. Stick figs into the liver by making apertures with
    the knife or with a needle.

    It is by no means clear that the liver is meant.



IV

TID-BITS, CHOPS, CUTLETS
  _OFFELLÆ_ [1]


[261] OSTIAN [2] MEAT BALLS
    _OFFELLÆ OSTIENSES_

PREPARE THE MEAT IN THIS MANNER [3] CLEAN THE MEAT [of bones, sinews,
etc.] SCRAPE IT AS THIN AS A SKIN [and shape it]. CRUSH PEPPER,
LOVAGE, CUMIN, CARRAWAY, SILPHIUM, ONE LAUREL BERRY, MOISTENED WITH
BROTH; IN A SQUARE DISH PLACE THE MEAT BALLS AND THE SPICES WHERE THEY
REMAIN IN PICKLING FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS, COVERED CROSSWISE WITH
TWIGS. THEN PLACE THEM IN THE OVEN [to be roasted], WHEN DONE TAKE THE
FINISHED MEAT BALLS OUT. CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, WITH THE BROTH, ADD A
LITTLE RAISIN WINE TO SWEETEN. COOK IT, THICKEN WITH ROUX, IMMERSE THE
BALLS IN THE SAUCE AND SERVE.

    [1] G.-V. _Ofellæ_; apparently the old Roman "Hamburger
    Steak." The term covers different small meat pieces,
    chops, steaks, etc.

    [2] Ostia, town at the mouth of the river Tiber, Rome's
    harbour.

    [3] Tor. sentence wanting in other texts.


[262] APICIAN ROULADES
    _OFFELLAS APICIANAS_

BONE THE MEAT FOR THE [roulades--a pork loin, roll it, tie it] OVEN,
SHAPE ROUND, COVER WITH OR WRAP IN RUSHES. [Roast] WHEN DONE, RETIRE,
ALLOW TO DRIP AND DRY ON THE GRIDIRON BUT SO THAT THE MEAT DOES NOT
HARDEN. CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, RUSH [1], CUMIN, ADDING BROTH AND RAISIN
WINE TO TASTE. PLACE THE ROULADES WITH THIS SAUCE TOGETHER IN A SAUCE
PAN [finish by braising] WHEN DONE, RETIRE THE ROULADES AND DRY THEM.
SERVE WITHOUT THE GRAVY SPRINKLED WITH PEPPER. IF TOO FAT REMOVE THE
OUTER SKIN [2].

    [1] _Cyperis_, _--os_, _--um_, _cypirus_, variants for a
    sort of rush; probably "Cyprian Grass."

    [2] Dann. Dumplings; but this formula appears to deal
    with boneless pork chops, pork roulades or "_filets
    mignons_."


[263] PORK CUTLETS, HUNTER STYLE
    _OFFELLÆ APRUGNEO _[1]_ MORE_

IN THE SAME MANNER YOU CAN MAKE TIDBITS OF SOW'S BELLY [2] PORK CHOPS
PREPARED IN A MANNER TO RESEMBLE WILD BOAR ARE [3] PICKLED IN OIL AND
BROTH AND PLACED IN SPICES. WHEN THE CUTLETS ARE DONE [marinated] THE
PICKLE IS PLACED ON THE FIRE AND BOILED; THE CUTLETS ARE PUT BACK INTO
THIS GRAVY AND ARE FINISHED WITH CRUSHED PEPPER, SPICES, HONEY, BROTH,
AND ROUX. WHEN THIS IS DONE SERVE THE CUTLETS WITHOUT THE BROTH AND
OIL, SPRINKLED WITH PEPPER.

    [1] G.-V. _Aprugineo_; List. _Offellæ Aprugneæ_, i.e.
    wild boar chops or cutlets. Vat. Ms. _aprogneo more_;
    Tor. _pro genuino more_; Tac. _aprogeneo_--from
    _aprugnus_, wild boar.

    Mutton today is prepared in a similar way, marinated
    with spices, etc., to resemble venison, and is called
    _Mouton à la Chasseur_, hunter style.

    [2] This sentence, probably belonging to the preceding
    formula, carried over by Torinus.

    [3] This sentence only in Torinus.


[264] TIDBITS ANOTHER WAY
    _ALITER OFFELLÆ_

THE BALLS OR CUTLETS ARE [1] PROPERLY FRIED IN THE PAN, NEARLY DONE.
[Next prepare the following] ONE WHOLE [2] GLASS BROTH, A GLASS OF
WATER, A GLASS OF VINEGAR AND A GLASS OF OIL, PROPERLY MIXED; PUT THIS
IN AN EARTHEN BAKING DISH [immerse meat pieces] FINISH ON THE FIRE AND
SERVE.

    [1] Tor.

    [2] Tor. _Summi_; List. _sumis_, i.e. broth of the pork.


[265] TIDBITS IN ANOTHER STYLE
    _ALITER OFFELLAS_

ALSO FRY THE CUTLETS THIS WAY: [1] IN A PAN WITH PLENTY OF WINE SAUCE,
SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE. [ANOTHER WAY] [2] THE CUTLETS
PREVIOUSLY SALT AND PICKLED IN A BROTH OF CUMIN, ARE PROPERLY FRIED
[3].

    [1] Tor. sentence wanting in other texts.

    [2] The texts have two formulæ; by the transposition of
    the two sentences the formula appears as a whole and
    one that is intelligible from a culinary point of view.

    [3] The texts have: _in aqua recte friguntur_; the
    _acqua_ presumably belongs to the cumin pickle. To fry
    in water is not possible.



V

CHOICE ROASTS [1]
  _ASSATURÆ_


[266] ROASTING, PLAIN
    _ASSATURAM SIMPLICEM_ [2]

SIMPLY PUT THE MEATS TO BE ROASTED IN THE OVEN, GENEROUSLY SPRINKLED
WITH SALT, AND SERVE [it glazed] WITH HONEY [3].

    [1] Tor. _De assaturæ exquisitæ apparatu_.

    [2] Brandt adds "plain."

    [3] Corresponding to our present method of roasting;
    fresh and processed ham is glazed with sugar.

    Roasting in the oven is not as desirable as roasting on
    the spit, universally practised during the middle ages.
    The spit seems to have been unknown to the Romans. It is
    seldom used today, although we have improved it by
    turning it with electrical machinery.


[267] ANOTHER STYLE FOR ROASTS
    _ALITER ASSATURAS_

TAKE 6 SCRUPLES OF PARSLEY, OF LASER [1] JUST AS MANY, 6 OF GINGER, 5
LAUREL BERRIES, 6 SCRUPLES OF PRESERVED LASER ROOT, CYPRIAN RUSH 6, 6
OF ORIGANY, A LITTLE COSTMARY, 3 SCRUPLES OF CHAMOMILE [or pellitory],
6 SCRUPLES OF CELERY SEED, 12 SCRUPLES OF PEPPER, AND BROTH AND OIL AS
MUCH AS IT WILL TAKE UP [2].

    [1] G.-V. _asareos_ [?] _Asarum_, the herb foalbit, wild
    spikenard.

    [2] No directions are given for the making of this
    compound which are essential to insure success of this
    formula. Outwardly it resembles some of the commercial
    sauces made principally in England (Worcestershire,
    etc.), which are served with every roast.


[268] ANOTHER [Condiment for] ROAST
    _ALITER ASSATURAS_

CRUSH DRY MYRTLE BERRIES WITH CUMIN AND PEPPER, ADDING HONEY ALSO
BROTH, REDUCED MUST AND OIL. HEAT AND BIND WITH ROUX. POUR THIS OVER
THE ROAST THAT IS MEDIUM DONE, WITH SALT; SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND
SERVE.


[269] ANOTHER ROAST [Sauce]
    _ALITER ASSATURAS_

6 SCRUPLES PEPPER, 6 SCRUPLES LOVAGE, 6 SCRUPLES PARSLEY, 6 SCRUPLES
CELERY SEED, 6 SCRUPLES DILL, 6 SCRUPLES LASER ROOT, 6 SCRUPLES WILD
SPIKENARD [1], 6 SCRUPLES CYPRIAN RUSH, 6 SCRUPLES CARRAWAY, 6
SCRUPLES CUMIN, 6 SCRUPLES GINGER, A PINT OF BROTH AND A SPOONFUL OIL.

    [1] Tor. _assareos_; cf. note 1 to ℞ No. 267.


[270] ROAST NECK [1]
    _ASSATURAS IN COLLARI_

PUT IN A BRAISIÈRE [2] AND BOIL PEPPER, SPICES, HONEY, BROTH; AND HEAT
THIS WITH THE MEAT IN THE OVEN. THE NECK PIECE ITSELF, IF YOU LIKE, IS
ALSO ROASTED WITH SPICES AND THE HOT GRAVY IS SIMPLY POURED OVER AT
THE MOMENT OF SERVING [3].

    [1] A piece of meat from the neck of a food animal,
    beef, veal, pork; a muscular hard piece, requiring much
    care to make it palatable, a "pot roast."

    [2] A roasting pan especially adapted for braising tough
    meats, with closefitting cover to hold the vapors.

    [3] Tor. combines this and the foregoing formula. G.-V.
    _siccum calidum_, for hot gravy. Perhaps a typographical
    error for _succum_.



VI

BOILED, STEWED MEATS, AND DAINTY FOOD
  _IN ELIXAM ET COPADIA_


[271] SAUCE FOR ALL BOILED DISHES
    _JUS IN ELIXAM OMNEM_

PEPPER, LOVAGE, ORIGANY, RUE, SILPHIUM, DRY ONION, WINE, REDUCED WINE,
HONEY, VINEGAR, A LITTLE OIL, BOILED DOWN, STRAINED THROUGH A CLOTH
AND POURED UNDER THE HOT COOKED MEATS [1].

    [1] A very complicated sauce for boiled viands. Most of
    the ingredients are found in the Worcestershire Sauce.


[272] SAUCE FOR BOILED VIANDS
    _JUS IN ELIXAM_

MAKE IT THUS: [Tor.] PEPPER, PARSLEY, BROTH, VINEGAR, FIG-DATES,
ONIONS, LITTLE OIL, POURED UNDER VERY HOT.


[273] ANOTHER
    _JUS IN ELIXAM_

CRUSH PEPPER, DRY RUE, FENNEL SEED, ONION, FIGDATES, WITH BROTH AND
OIL.


[274] WHITE [bread] [1] SAUCE FOR BOILED VIANDS
    _JUS CANDIDUM IN ELIXAM_

WHITE SAUCE FOR BOILED DISHES IS MADE THUS: [2] PEPPER, BROTH, WINE,
RUE, ONIONS, NUTS, A LITTLE SPICE, BREAD SOAKED TO THE SATURATION
POINT, OIL, WHICH IS COOKED AND SPREAD UNDER [the meat].

    [1] Our present bread sauce, somewhat simpler, but
    essentially the same as the Apician sauce, is very
    popular with roast partridge, pheasant and other game in
    England.

    [2] Tor. sentence wanting in other texts.


[275] ANOTHER WHITE SAUCE FOR BOILED VIANDS
    _ALITER JUS CANDIDUM IN ELIXAM_

ANOTHER WHITE SAUCE FOR BOILED DISHES CONTAINS: [1] PEPPER, CARRAWAY,
LOVAGE, THYME, ORIGANY, SHALLOTS, DATES, HONEY, VINEGAR, BROTH AND
OIL.


[276] WHITE SAUCE FOR DAINTY FOOD
    _IN COPADIIS _[1]_ JUS ALBUM_

TAKE CUMIN, LOVAGE, RUE SEED, PLUMS FROM DAMASCUS [2] SOAK IN WINE,
ADD HONEY MEAD AND VINEGAR, THYME AND ORIGANY TO TASTE [3].

    [1] Lacking definite description of the _copadia_ it is
    hard to differentiate between them and the
    _offelæ_.--_Cupedia_ (Plaut. and Goll.), nice dainty
    dishes, from _cupiditas_, appetite, desire for dainty
    fare. Hence _cupedinarius_ (Terent.) and _cupediarius_
    (Lamprid.) a seller or maker of dainties, a
    confectioner.

    [2] _Damascena_; they correspond apparently to our
    present stewed (dried) prunes. It is inconceivable how
    this sauce can be white in color, but, as a condiment
    and if taken in small quantity, it has our full
    approval.

    [3] G.-V. _agitabis_, i.e. stir the sauce with a whip of
    thyme and origany twigs. Cf. note to following.


[277] ANOTHER WHITE SAUCE FOR APPETIZERS
    _ALITER JUS CANDIDUM IN COPADIIS_

IS MADE THUS [1] PEPPER, THYME, CUMIN, CELERY SEED, FENNEL, RUE, MINT
[2], MYRTLE BERRIES, RAISINS, RAISIN WINE, AND MEAD TO TASTE; STIR IT
WITH A TWIG OF SATURY [3].

    [1] Tor.

    [2] G.-V., rue wanting.

    [3] An ingenious way to impart a very subtle flavor. The
    sporadic discoveries of such very subtle and refined
    methods (cf. notes to ℞ No. 15) should dispell once
    and for all time the old theories that the ancients were
    using spices to excess. They simply used a greater
    variety of flavors and aromas than we do today, but
    there is no proof that spices were used excessively. The
    great variety of flavors at the disposal of the ancients
    speaks well for the refinement of the olfactory sense
    and the desire to bring variety into their fare. Cf.
    ℞ Nos. 345, 369 and 385.


[278] SAUCE FOR TIDBITS
    _JUS IN COPADIIS_

PEPPER, LOVAGE, CARRAWAY, MINT, LEAVES OF SPIKENARD (WHICH THE GREEKS
CALL "NARDOSACHIOM") [_sic!_] [1] YOLKS, HONEY, MEAD, VINEGAR, BROTH
AND OIL. STIR WELL WITH SATURY AND LEEKS [2] AND TIE WITH ROUX.

    [1] Tor. [_sic!_] _spicam nardi_--sentence wanting in
    other texts. G.-V. _nardostachyum_, spikenard.

    [2] A fagot of satury and leeks! Cf. notes to ℞ Nos.
    276 and 277.


[279] WHITE SAUCE FOR TIDBITS
    _JUS ALBUM IN COPADIIS_

IS MADE THUS: [1] PEPPER, LOVAGE, CUMIN, CELERY SEED, THYME, NUTS,
WHICH SOAK AND CLEAN, HONEY, VINEGAR, BROTH AND OIL TO BE ADDED [2].

    [1, 2] First three and last three words in Tor.


[280] SAUCE FOR TIDBITS
    _JUS IN COPADIIS_

PEPPER, CELERY SEED, CARRAWAY, SATURY, SAFFRON, SHALLOTS, TOASTED

CHOP HARD EGGS, PEPPER, CUMIN, PARSLEY, COOKED LEEKS, MYRTLE BERRIES,
SOMEWHAT MORE HONEY, VINEGAR, BROTH AND OIL.


[283] RAW DILL SAUCE FOR BOILED DISH
    _IN ELIXAM ANETHATUM CRUDUM_

PEPPER, DILL SEED, DRY MINT, LASER ROOT, POUR UNDER: VINEGAR, DATE
WINE, HONEY, BROTH, AND A LITTLE MUSTARD, REDUCED MUST AND OIL TO
TASTE; AND SERVE IT WITH ROAST PORK SHOULDER.


[284] BRINY SAUCE FOR BOILED DISH
    _JUS IN ELIXAM ALLECATUM_

PEPPER, LOVAGE, CARRAWAY, CELERY SEED, THYME, SHALLOTS, DATES, FISH
BRINE [1] STRAINED HONEY, AND WINE TO TASTE; SPRINKLE WITH CHOPPED
GREEN CELERY AND OIL AND SERVE.

    [1] G.-V. _allecem_; Tor. _Halecem_.



VII

PAUNCH
  _VENTRICULA_


[285] PIG'S PAUNCH
    _VENTREM PORCINUM_

CLEAN THE PAUNCH OF A SUCKLING PIG WELL WITH SALT AND VINEGAR AND
PRESENTLY WASH WITH WATER. THEN FILL IT WITH THE FOLLOWING DRESSING:
PIECES OF PORK POUNDED IN THE MORTAR, THREE BRAINS--THE NERVES
REMOVED--MIX WITH RAW EGGS, ADD NUTS, WHOLE PEPPER, AND SAUCE TO
TASTE. CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, SILPHIUM, ANISE, GINGER, A LITTLE RUE;
FILL THE PAUNCH WITH IT, NOT TOO MUCH, THOUGH, LEAVING PLENTY OF ROOM
FOR EXPANSION LEST IT BURSTS WHILE BEING COOKED. PUT IT IN A POT WITH
BOILING WATER, RETIRE AND PRICK WITH A NEEDLE SO THAT IT DOES NOT
BURST. WHEN HALF DONE, TAKE IT OUT AND HANG IT INTO THE SMOKE TO TAKE
ON COLOR; NOW BOIL IT OVER AGAIN AND FINISH IT LEISURELY. NEXT TAKE
THE BROTH, SOME PURE WINE AND A LITTLE OIL, OPEN THE PAUNCH WITH A
SMALL KNIFE. SPRINKLE WITH THE BROTH AND LOVAGE; PLACE THE PIG NEAR
THE FIRE TO HEAT IT, TURN IT AROUND IN BRAN [or bread crumbs] IMMERSE
IN [sprinkle with] BRINE AND FINISH [the outer crust to a golden
brown] [1].

    [1] The good old English way of finishing a roast joint
    called dredging.

    Lister has this formula divided into two; Danneil and Schuch
    make three different formulas out of it.



VIII

LOINS AND KIDNEYS
  _LUMBI ET RENES_


[286] ROAST LOINS MADE THUS
    _LUMBULI ASSI ITA FIUNT_

SPLIT THEM INTO TWO PARTS SO THAT THEY ARE SPREAD OUT [1] SPRINKLE THE
OPENING WITH CRUSHED PEPPER AND [ditto] NUTS, FINELY CHOPPED CORIANDER
AND CRUSHED FENNEL SEED. THE TENDERLOINS ARE THEN ROLLED UP TO BE
ROASTED; TIE TOGETHER, WRAP IN CAUL, PARBOIL IN OIL [2] AND BROTH, AND
THEN ROAST IN THE OVEN OR BROIL ON THE GRIDIRON.

    [1] "Frenched," the meat here being pork tenderloin.

    [2] G.-V. best broth and a little oil, which is more
    acceptable.



IX

HAM
  _PERNA_


[287] [Baked Picnic] HAM [Pork Shoulder, fresh or cured]
    _PERNAM_

THE HAM SHOULD BE BRAISED WITH A GOOD NUMBER OF FIGS AND SOME THREE
LAUREL LEAVES; THE SKIN IS THEN PULLED OFF AND CUT INTO SQUARE PIECES;
THESE ARE MACERATED WITH HONEY. THEREUPON MAKE DOUGH CRUMBS OF FLOUR
AND OIL [1] LAY THE DOUGH OVER OR AROUND THE HAM, STUD THE TOP WITH
THE PIECES OF THE SKIN SO THAT THEY WILL BE BAKED WITH THE DOUGH [bake
slowly] AND WHEN DONE, RETIRE FROM THE OVEN AND SERVE [2].

    [1] Ordinary pie or pastry dough, or perhaps a
    preparation similar to streusel, unsweetened.

    [2] Experimenting with this formula, we have adhered to
    the instructions as closely as possible, using regular
    pie dough to envelop the parboiled meat. The figs were
    retired from the sauce pan long before the meat was done
    and they were served around the ham as a garnish. As a
    consequence we partook of a grand dish that no inmate of
    Olympus would have sneezed at.

    In Pompeii an inn-keeper had written the following on
    the wall of his establishment: _Ubi perna cocta est si
    convivæ apponitur non gustat pernam linguit ollam aut
    caccabum._

    When we first beheld this message we took the inn-keeper
    for a humorist and clever advertiser; but now we are
    convinced that he was in earnest when he said that his
    guests would lick the sauce pan in which his hams were
    cooked.


[288] TO COOK PORK SHOULDER
    _PERNÆ _[1]_ COCTURAM_

HAM SIMPLY COOKED IN WATER WITH FIGS IS USUALLY DRESSED ON A PLATTER
[baking pan] SPRINKLED WITH CRUMBS AND REDUCED WINE, OR, STILL BETTER,
WITH SPICED WINE [and is glazed under the open flame, or with a shovel
containing red-hot embers].

    [1] _Perna_ is usually applied to shoulder of pork,
    fresh, also cured.

    _Coxa_ is the hind leg, or haunch of pork, or fresh ham.
    Cf. note 1 to ℞ No. 289.



X


[289] FRESH HAM
    _MUSTEIS _[1]_ PETASONEM_ [2]

A FRESH HAM IS COOKED WITH 2 POUNDS OF BARLEY AND 25 FIGS. WHEN DONE
SKIN, GLAZE THE SURFACE WITH A FIRE SHOVEL FULL OF GLOWING COALS,
SPREAD HONEY OVER IT, OR, WHAT'S BETTER: PUT IT IN THE OVEN COVERED
WITH HONEY. WHEN IT HAS A NICE COLOR, PUT IN A SAUCE PAN RAISIN WINE,
PEPPER, A BUNCH OF RUE AND PURE WINE TO TASTE. WHEN THIS [sauce] IS
DONE, POUR HALF OF IT OVER THE HAM AND IN THE OTHER HALF SOAK
SPECIALLY MADE GINGER BREAD [3] THE REMNANT OF THE SAUCE AFTER MOST OF
IT IS THOROUGHLY SOAKED INTO THE BREAD, ADD TO THE HAM [4].

    [1] _Musteus_, fresh, young, new; _vinum mustum_, new
    wine, must. Properly perhaps, _Petasonem ex mustaceis_;
    cf. note 3.

    [2] Hum. _verum petaso coxa cum crure_ [shank] _esse
    dicitur...._

    Plainly, we are dealing here with fresh, uncured ham.

    [3] A certain biscuit or cake made of must, spices and
    pepper, perhaps baked on laurel leaves. _Mustaceus_ was
    a kind of cake, the flour of which had been kneaded with
    must, cheese, anise, etc., the cake was baked upon
    laurel leaves.

    [4] Tor. continues without interruption. He has the
    three foregoing formulæ thrown into one.



XI


[290] BACON, SALT PORK
    _LARIDI _[1]_ COCTURA_

COVER WITH WATER AND COOK WITH PLENTY OF DILL; SPRINKLE WITH A LITTLE
OIL AND A TRIFLE OF SALT.

    [1] Lister, at this point, has forgotten his explanation
    of _laridum_, and now accepts the word in its proper
    sense. This rather belated correction by Lister
    confirms the correctness of our own earlier
    observations. Cf. note to ℞ Nos. 41 and 148.



XII

LIVERS AND LUNGS
  _JECINORA SIVE PULMONES_


[291] SHEEP LIVER
    _JECINORA HŒDINA VEL AGNINA_ [1]

COOK THUS: MAKE A MIXTURE OF WATER, MEAD, EGGS AND MILK IN WHICH
THOROUGHLY SOAK THE SLICED LIVER. STEW THE LIVER IN WINE SAUCE,
SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.

    [1] G.-V. _Iecinera hœdina_.


[292] ANOTHER WAY TO COOK LUNG
    _ALITER IN PULMONIBUS_

LIVER AND LUNG ARE ALSO COOKED THIS WAY: [1] SOAK WELL IN MILK, STRAIN
IT OFF IF OFFENSIVE IN TASTE [2] BREAK 2 EGGS AND ADD A LITTLE SALT,
MIX IN A SPOONFUL HONEY AND FILL THE LUNG WITH IT, BOIL AND SLICE [3].

    [1] Tor.

    [2] Lungs of slaughtered animals are little used
    nowadays. The soaking of livers in milk is quite common;
    it removes the offensive taste of the gall.

    [3] G.-V. continue without interruption.


[293] A HASH OF LIVER
    _ALITER_

CRUSH PEPPER, MOISTEN WITH BROTH, RAISIN WINE, PURE OIL, CHOP THE
LIGHTS [1] FINE AND ADD WINE SAUCE [2].

    [1] Edible intestines, livers, lung, kidney, etc., are
    thus named.

    [2] List., Tor., G.-V. have both recipes in one. Dann.
    is in doubt whether to separate them or not.



XIII

HOME-MADE SWEET DISHES AND HONEY SWEET-MEATS
  _DULCIA DOMESTICA _[1]_ ET MELCÆ_


[294] HOME-MADE SWEETS
    _DULCIA DOMESTICA_

LITTLE HOME CONFECTIONS (WHICH ARE CALLED DULCIARIA) ARE MADE THUS:
[2] LITTLE PALMS OR (AS THEY ARE ORDINARILY CALLED) [3] DATES ARE
STUFFED--AFTER THE SEEDS HAVE BEEN REMOVED--WITH A NUT OR WITH NUTS
AND GROUND PEPPER, SPRINKLED WITH SALT ON THE OUTSIDE AND ARE CANDIED
IN HONEY AND SERVED [4].

    [1] _Dulcia_, sweetmeats, cakes; hence _dulciarius_, a
    pastry cook or confectioner.

    The fact that here attention is drawn to home-made sweet
    dishes may clear up the absence of regular baking and
    dessert formulæ in Apicius. The trade of the
    _dulciarius_ was so highly developed at that time that
    the professional bakers and confectioners supplied the
    entire home market with their wares, making it
    convenient and unprofitable for the domestic cook to
    compete with their organized business, a condition which
    largely exists in our modern highly civilized centers of
    population today. Cf. "Cooks."

    [2 + 3] Tor.

    [4] Still being done today in the same manner.


[295] ANOTHER SWEETMEAT
    _ALITER DULCIA_

GRATE [scrape, peel] SOME VERY BEST FRESH APHROS [1] AND IMMERSE IN
MILK. WHEN SATURATED PLACE IN THE OVEN TO HEAT BUT NOT TO DRY OUT;
WHEN THOROUGHLY HOT RETIRE FROM OVEN, POUR OVER SOME HONEY, STIPPLE
[the fruit] SO THAT THE HONEY MAY PENETRATE, SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER [2]
AND SERVE.

    [1] Tor., Tac., Lan. _musteos aphros_; Vat. Ms., G.-V.
    _afros_; List. _apios_, i.e. celery, which is farthest
    from the mark. Goll. interprets this a "cider apple,"
    reminiscent, probably, of _musteos_, which is fresh,
    new, young, and which has here nothing to do with cider.

    _Aphros_ is not identified. Perhaps the term stood for
    Apricots (Old English: Aphricocks) or some other African
    fruit or plant; Lister's celery is to be rejected on
    gastronomical grounds.

    The above treatment would correspond to that which is
    given apricots and peaches today. They are peeled,
    immersed in cream and sweetened with sugar. Apicius'
    heating of the fruit in milk is new to us; it sounds
    good, for it has a tendency to parboil any hard fruit,
    make it more digestible and reduce the fluid to a creamy
    consistency.

    [2] The "pepper" again, as pointed out in several other
    places, here is some spice of agreeable taste as are
    used in desserts today.


[296] ANOTHER SWEET DISH
    _ALITER DULCIA_

BREAK [slice] FINE WHITE BREAD, CRUST REMOVED, INTO RATHER LARGE
PIECES WHICH SOAK IN MILK [and beaten eggs] FRY IN OIL, COVER WITH
HONEY AND SERVE [1].

    [1] "French" Toast, indeed!--_Sapienti sat!_


[297] ANOTHER SWEET
    _ALITER DULCIA_

IN A CHAFING-DISH PUT [1] HONEY, PURE WINE, RAISIN WINE, RUE, PINE
NUTS, NUTS, COOKED SPELT, ADD CRUSHED AND TOASTED HAZELNUTS [2] AND
SERVE.

    [1] G.-V. _Piperato mittis_. _Piperatum_ is a dish
    prepared with pepper, any spicy dish; the term may here
    be applied to the bowl in which the porridge is served.
    Tac. _Dulcia piperata mittis_.

    [2] Dann. Almonds.


[298] ANOTHER SWEET
    _ALITER DULCIA_

CRUSH PEPPER, NUTS, HONEY, RUE, AND RAISIN WINE WITH MILK, AND COOK
THE MIXTURE [1] WITH A FEW EGGS WELL WORKED IN, COVER WITH HONEY,
SPRINKLE WITH [crushed nuts, etc.] AND SERVE.

    [1] _Tractam_, probably with a starch added, or else it
    is a nut custard, practically a repetition of ℞ Nos.
    129 and 143.


[299] ANOTHER SWEET
    _ALITER DULCIA_

TAKE A PREPARATION SIMILAR [1] [to the above] AND IN THE HOT WATER
[bath or double boiler] MAKE A VERY HARD PORRIDGE OF IT. THEREUPON
SPREAD IT OUT ON A PAN AND WHEN COOL CUT IT INTO HANDY PIECES LIKE
SMALL COOKIES. FRY THESE IN THE BEST OIL, TAKE THEM OUT, DIP INTO
[hot] HONEY, SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER [2] AND SERVE.

    [1] This confirms the assumption that some flour or meal
    is used in ℞ No. 298 also without which this present
    preparation would not "stand up."

    [2] It is freely admitted that the word "pepper" not
    always stands for the spice that we know by this name.
    Cf. note 2 to ℞ No. 295 _et al._


[300] A STILL BETTER WAY
    _ALITER_

IS TO PREPARE THIS WITH MILK INSTEAD OF WATER.


[301] CUSTARD
    _TYROPATINAM_

ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF MILK NECESSARY FOR THIS DISH AND SWEETEN IT
WITH HONEY TO TASTE; TO A PINT [1] OF FLUID TAKE 5 EGGS; FOR HALF A
PINT [2] DISSOLVE 3 EGGS IN MILK AND BEAT WELL TO INCORPORATE
THOROUGHLY, STRAIN THROUGH A COLANDER INTO AN EARTHEN DISH AND COOK ON
A SLOW FIRE [in hot water bath in oven]. WHEN CONGEALED SPRINKLE WITH
PEPPER AND SERVE [3].

    [1] _Sextarium._

    [2] _ad heminam._

    [3] Dann. calls this a cheese cake, which is a
    far-fetched conclusion, although standard dictionaries
    say that the _tyropatina_ is a kind of cheese cake. It
    must be borne in mind, however, that the ancient
    definition of "custard" is "egg cheese," probably
    because of the similarity in appearance and texture.

    Cf. ℞ Nos. 129 and 143.


[302] OMELETTE SOUFFLÉE [1]
    _OVA SPHONGIA EX LACTE_

FOUR EGGS IN HALF A PINT OF MILK AND AN OUNCE OF OIL WELL BEATEN, TO
MAKE A FLUFFY MIXTURE; IN A PAN PUT A LITTLE OIL, AND CAREFULLY ADD
THE EGG PREPARATION, WITHOUT LETTING IT BOIL [2] HOWEVER. [Place it in
the oven to let it rise] AND WHEN ONE SIDE IS DONE, TURN IT OUT INTO A
SERVICE PLATTER [fold it] POUR OVER HONEY, SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER [3]
AND SERVE [4].

    [1] Dann. misled by the title, interprets this dish as
    "Floating Island"; he, the chef, has completely
    misunderstood the ancient formula.

    [2] Tor. _sinas bullire_--which is correct. List.
    _facies ut bulliat_--which is monstrous.

    [3] G.-V.

    [4] Tor. continues without interruption.


[303] CHEESE AND HONEY
    _MEL ET CASEUM_ [1]

PREPARE [cottage] CHEESE EITHER WITH HONEY AND BROTH [brine] OR WITH
SALT, OIL AND [chopped] CORIANDER [2].

    [1] G.-V. _Melca ... stum_; List. _mel castum_, refined
    honey; Tac. _Mel caseum_; Tor. _mel, caseum_. Cf. ℞
    No. 294.

    [2] To season cottage (fresh curd) cheese today we use
    salt, pepper, cream, carraway or chopped chives;
    sometimes a little sugar.



XIV


[304] BULBS [1]
    _BULBOS_

SERVE WITH OIL, BROTH AND VINEGAR, WITH A LITTLE CUMIN SPRINKLED OVER.

    [1] Onions, roots of tulips, narcissus. Served raw
    sliced, with the above dressing, or cooked. Cf. notes to
    ℞ No. 307.


[305] ANOTHER WAY
    _ALITER_

SOAK [1] THE BULBS AND PARBOIL THEM IN WATER; THEREUPON FRY THEM IN
OIL. THE DRESSING MAKE THUS: TAKE THYME, FLEA-BANE, PEPPER, ORIGANY,
HONEY, VINEGAR, REDUCED WINE, DATE WINE, IF YOU LIKE [2] BROTH AND A
LITTLE OIL. SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.

    [1] Tor. _tundes_; probably a typographical error, as
    this should read _fundis_, i.e. _infundis_. Wanting in
    the other texts.


[306] ANOTHER WAY
    _ALITER_

COOK THE BULBS INTO A THICK PURÉE [1] AND SEASON WITH THYME, ORIGANY,
HONEY, VINEGAR, REDUCED WINE, DATE WINE, BROTH AND A LITTLE OIL.

    [1] _Tundes_, i.e. mash. Practically a correction of
    ℞ No. 305, repeated by Tor.


[307] VARRO SAYS OF BULBS [1]
    _VARRO SI QUID DE BULBIS DIXIT_

COOKED IN WATER THEY ARE CONDUCIVE TO LOVE [2] AND ARE THEREFORE ALSO
SERVED AT WEDDING FEASTS, BUT ALSO SEASONED WITH PIGNOLIA NUT OR WITH
THE JUICE OF COLEWORT, OR MUSTARD, AND PEPPER.

    [1] The first instance in Apicius where the monotony and
    business-like recital of recipes is broken by some
    interesting quotation or remark.

    Brandt is of the opinion that this remark was added by a
    posterior reader.

    [2] The texts: _qui Veneris ostium quærunt_--"seek the
    mouth of Venus."

    This favorite superstition of the ancients leads many
    writers, as might be expected, into fanciful
    speculations. Humelberg, quoting Martial, says: _Veneram
    mirè stimulant, unde et salaces à Martiali vocantur._ 1.
    XIII, Ep. 34:

    _Cum sit anus conjunx, cum sint tibi mortua membra
    Nil aliud, bulbis quam satur esse potes._

    We fail to find this quotation from Varro in his works,
    M. Teren. Varronis De Re Rustica, Lugduni, 1541, but we
    read in Columella and Pliny that the buds or shoots of
    reeds were called by some "bulbs," by others "eyes,"
    and, remembering that these shoots make very desirable
    vegetables when properly cooked, we feel inclined to
    include these among the term "bulbs." Platina also adds
    the squill or sea onion to this category. Nonnus, p. 84,
    Diæteticon, Antwerp, 1645, quotes Columella as saying:
    _Jam Magaris veniant genitalia semina Bulbi._

    Truffles, among all earthly things, are the most
    delicate and most subtle in flavor. Only a master cook
    is privileged to handle them and to do them justice.

    Today, whenever we are fortunate enough to obtain the
    best fresh truffles, we are pursuing almost the same
    methods of preparation as described by Apicius.

TARO, DASHEEN
  _IN COLOCASIO_


[322] COLOCASIUM [1] TARO, DASHEEN
    _COLOCASIUM_

FOR THE COLOCASIUM (WHICH IS REALLY THE COLOCASIA PLANT, ALSO CALLED
"EGYPTIAN BEAN") USE [2] PEPPER, CUMIN, RUE, HONEY, OR BROTH, AND A
LITTLE OIL; WHEN DONE BIND WITH ROUX [3] COLOCASIUM IS THE ROOT OF THE
EGYPTIAN BEAN WHICH IS USED EXCLUSIVELY [4].

    [1] Cf. notes to ℞ Nos. 74, 172, 216, 244; also the
    copious explanations by Humelberg, fol. III.

    [2] Tor. who is trying hard to explain the _colocasium_.
    His name, "Egyptian Bean" may be due to the mealiness
    and bean-like texture of the _colocasium_ tuber;
    otherwise there is no resemblance to a bean, except,
    perhaps, the seed pod which is not used for food. This
    simile has led other commentators to believe that the
    _colocasium_ in reality was a bean.

    The U.S. Department of Agriculture has in recent years
    imported various specimens of that taro species
    (belonging to the _colocasia_), and the plants are now
    successfully being farmed in the southern parts of the
    United States, with fair prospects of becoming an
    important article of daily diet. The Department has
    favored us repeatedly with samples of the taro, or
    dasheen, (_Colocasium Antiquorum_) and we have made many
    different experiments with this agreeable, delightful
    and important "new" vegetable. It can be prepared in
    every way like a potato, and possesses advantages over
    the potato as far as value of nutrition, flavor, culture
    and keeping qualities are concerned. As a commercial
    article, it is not any more expensive than any good kind
    of potato. It grows where the potato will not thrive,
    and vice versa. It thus saves much in freight to parts
    where the potato does not grow.

    The ancient _colocasium_ is no doubt a close relative of
    the modern dasheen or taro. The Apician _colocasium_ was
    perhaps very similar to the ordinary Elephant-Ear,
    _colocasium Antiquorum Schott_, often called _caladium
    esculentum_, or _tanyah_, more recently called the
    "Dasheen" which is a corruption of the French "de
    Chine"--from China--indicating the supposed origin of
    this variety of taro. The dasheen is a broad-leaved
    member of the _arum_ family. The name dasheen originated
    in the West Indies whence it was imported into the
    United States around 1910, and the name is now
    officially adopted.

    Mark Catesby, in his Natural History of Carolina,
    Florida and the Bahama Islands, London, 1781, describes
    briefly under the name of _arum maximum Aegypticum_ a
    plant which was doubtless one of the tanyahs or taros.
    He says: "This was a welcome improvement among the
    negroes and was esteemed a blessing; they being
    delighted with all their African food, particularly
    this, which a great part of Africa subsists much on."

    Torinus, groping for the right name, calls it variously
    _colosium_, _coledium_, _coloesium_, till he finally
    gets it right, _colocasium_.

    [3] The root or tubers of this plant was used by the
    ancients as a vegetable. They probably boiled and then
    peeled and sliced the tubers, seasoning the pieces with
    the above ingredients, heated them in bouillon stock and
    thickened the gravy in the usual way. Since the tuber is
    very starchy, little roux is required for binding.

    margin of his book.

SNAILS
  _COCHLEAS_


[323] MILK-FED SNAILS
    _COCHLEAS LACTE PASTAS_

TAKE SNAILS AND SPONGE THEM; PULL THEM OUT OF THE SHELLS BY THE
MEMBRANE AND PLACE THEM FOR A DAY IN A VESSEL WITH MILK AND SALT [1]
RENEW THE MILK DAILY. HOURLY [2] CLEAN THE SNAILS OF ALL REFUSE, AND
WHEN THEY ARE SO FAT THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER RETIRE [to their shells]
FRY THEM IN OIL AND SERVE THEM WITH WINE SAUCE. IN A SIMILAR WAY THEY
MAY BE FED ON A MILK PORRIDGE [3].

    [1] Just enough so they do not drown.

    [2] Wanting in Tor.

    [3] The Romans raised snails for the table in special
    places called _cochlearia_. Fluvius Hirpinus is credited
    with having popularized the snail in Rome a little
    before the civil wars between Cæsar and Pompey. If we
    could believe Varro, snails grew to enormous
    proportions. A supper of the younger Pliny consisted of
    a head of lettuce, three snails, two eggs, a barley
    cake, sweet wine, refrigerated in snow.

    Snails as a food are not sufficiently appreciated by the
    Germanic races who do not hesitate to eat similar
    animals and are very fond of such food as oysters,
    clams, mussels, cocles, etc., much of which they even
    eat in the raw state.


[324] ANOTHER WAY
    _ALITER_

THE SNAILS ARE FRIED WITH PURE SALT AND OIL AND [a sauce of] LASER,
BROTH, PEPPER AND OIL IS UNDERLAID; OR THE FRIED SNAILS ARE FULLY
COVERED WITH BROTH, PEPPER AND CUMIN.

[325] ANOTHER WAY FOR SNAILS

    [1] G.-V., List. _in ovi fero_; Dann. "wild eggs," i.e.,
    the eggs of game birds, and he comes to the conclusion
    that game birds themselves are meant to be used in this
    formula, as no reference to "eggs" is made.

    There can be no doubt but what this formula deals with
    the preparation of sheep; Torinus says expressly:
    _oviferum, hoc est, carnem ovis sylvestris_--the meat of
    sheep from the woods, mountain sheep. _Ferum_ is "wild,"
    "game," but it also means "pregnant." For this double
    sense the formula may be interpreted as dealing with
    either wild sheep, or with pregnant sheep, or, more
    probably, with unborn baby lamb, which in antiquity as
    today is often killed principally for its skin.

    [2] Tor.

    [3] Mint is still associated with lamb; the above sauce
    appears to be merely an elaborate Roman ancestor of our

[351] VEAL STEAK
    _VITELLINA FRICTA_ [1]

[FOR A SAUCE WITH FRIED BEEF OR VEAL TAKE] [2] PEPPER, LOVAGE, CELERY
SEED, CUMIN, ORIGANY, DRY ONION, RAISINS, HONEY, VINEGAR, WINE, BROTH,
OIL, AND REDUCED MUST.

    [1] Evidently a beef or veal steak _sauté_. Beef did not
    figure very heavily on the dietary of the ancients in
    contrasts to present modes which make beef the most
    important meat, culinarily speaking. The above sauce,
    save for the raisins and the honey, resembles the modern
    _Bordelaise_, often served with beef steaks _sauté_, in
    contrast to the grilled steaks which are served with
    _maître d'hôtel_ butter.


[352] VEAL OR BEEF WITH LEEKS
    _VITULINAM [1] SIVE BULULAM CUM PORRIS_

[or] WITH QUINCES [2] OR WITH ONIONS, OR WITH DASHEENS [3] [use]
BROTH, PEPPER, LASER AND A LITTLE OIL.

    [1] G.-V. same as _vitellinam_.

    [2] Tor. _cydoniis_; List. _succidaneis_.

    [3] Cf. ℞ No. 332 _et al._


[353] FRICASSÉE OF VEAL
    _IN VITULINAM ELIXAM_

CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, CARRAWAY, CELERY SEED, MOISTEN WITH HONEY,
VINEGAR, BROTH AND OIL; HEAT, BIND WITH ROUX AND COVER THE MEAT.


[354] ANOTHER VEAL FRICASSÉE
    _ALITER IN VITULINA EXLIXA_

PEPPER, LOVAGE, FENNEL SEED, ORIGANY, NUTS, FIGDATES, HONEY, VINEGAR,
BROTH, MUSTARD AND OIL.

KID OR LAMB
  _IN HÆDO VEL AGNO_


[355] DAINTY DISHES OF KID OR OF LAMB
    _COPADIA HÆDINA SIVE AGNINA_

COOK WITH PEPPER AND BROTH, ALSO WITH VARIOUS ORDINARY BEANS [1]
BROTH, PEPPER AND LASER, CUMIN, DUMPLINGS [2] AND A LITTLE OIL [3].

    [1] _cum faseolis_, green string beans.

    [2] Tor. _imbrato_; G.-V. _inbracto_, broken bread,
    regular dumplings.

    [3] Lamb and beans is a favorite combination, as in the
    French _haricot_, made with white beans, or boiled lamb
    with fresh string beans, quite a modern dish. Torinus
    omits the cumin, which is quite characteristic.


[356] ANOTHER LAMB STEW
    _ALITER HÆDINAM SIVE AGNINAM EXCALDATAM_

PUT [pieces of] KID OR LAMB IN THE STEW POT WITH CHOPPED ONION AND
CORIANDER. CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, CUMIN, AND COOK WITH BROTH OIL AND
WINE. PUT IN A DISH AND TIE WITH ROUX [1].

    [1] It appears that the binding should be done before
    the stew is dished out; but this sentence illustrates
    the consummate art of Apicius. The good cook carefully
    separates the meat (as it is cooked) from the sauce,
    eliminates impurities, binds and strains it and puts the
    meat back into the finished sauce. This is the ideal way
    of making a stew which evidently was known to Apicius.


[357] ANOTHER LAMB STEW
    _ALITER HÆDINAM SIVE AGNINAM EXCALDATAM_

ADD TO THE PARBOILED MEAT THE RAW HERBS THAT HAVE BEEN CRUSHED IN THE
MORTAR AND COOK IT. GOAT MEAT IS COOKED LIKEWISE.


[358] BROILED KID OR LAMB STEAK
    _HÆDUM SIVE AGNUM ASSUM_

KID AFTER BEING COOKED IN BROTH AND OIL IS SLICED AND MARINATED [1]
WITH CRUSHED PEPPER, LASER, BROTH AND A LITTLE OIL. IT IS THEN GRILLED
ON THE BROILER AND SERVED WITH GRAVY. SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE
UP.

    [1] The marinade is used to make the gravy.


[359] ROAST KID OR LAMB
    _ALITER HÆDUM SIVE AGNUM ASSUM_

[LET US ROAST THE KID OR LAMB, ADDING] [1] HALF AN OUNCE OF PEPPER, 6
SCRUPLES OF FOALBIT [2] A LITTLE GINGER, 6 SCRUPLES OF PARSLEY, A
LITTLE LASER, A PINT OF BEST BROTH AND A SPOONFUL OIL [3].

    [1] Tor.

    [2] _Asarum_; Tor. _aseros_; List. _asareos_--the herb
    foalbit, foalfoot, wild spikenard.

    [3] Tor. continues without interruption.


[360] STUFFED BONED KID OR LAMB
    _HÆDUS SIVE AGNUS SYRINGIATUS_ [1]

MILK-FED [2] KID OR LAMB IS CAREFULLY BONED THROUGH THE THROAT SO AS
TO CREATE A PAUNCH OR BAG; THE INTESTINES ARE PRESERVED WHOLE IN A
MANNER THAT ONE CAN BLOW OR INFLATE THEM AT THE HEAD IN ORDER TO EXPEL
THE EXCREMENTS AT THE OTHER END; THE BODY IS WASHED CAREFULLY AND IS
FILLED WITH A LIQUID DRESSING. THEREUPON TIE IT CAREFULLY AT THE
SHOULDERS, PUT IT INTO THE ROASTING PAN, BASTE WELL. WHEN DONE, BOIL
THE GRAVY WITH MILK AND PEPPER, PREVIOUSLY CRUSHED, AND BROTH, REDUCED
WINE, A LITTLE REDUCED MUST AND ALSO OIL; AND TO THE BOILING GRAVY ADD
ROUX. TO PLAY SAFE PUT THE ROAST IN A NETTING, BAG OR LITTLE BASKET
AND CAREFULLY TIE TOGETHER, ADD A LITTLE SALT TO THE BOILING GRAVY.
AFTER THIS HAS BOILED WELL THREE TIMES, TAKE THE MEAT OUT, BOIL THE
BROTH OVER AGAIN [to reduce it] INCORPORATE WITH THE ABOVE DESCRIBED
LIQUOR, ADDING THE NECESSARY SEASONING.

    [1] "Hollowed out like a pipe."

    [2] G.-V. _syringiatus_ (_id est mammotestus_). Tor.
    _mammocestis_. We are guessing.

    [3] We would call this a galantine of lamb if such a
    dish were made of lamb today.

    This article, like the following appears to be a
    contraction of two different formulæ.


[361] STUFFED KID OR LAMB ANOTHER WAY
    _ALITER HÆDUS SIVE AGNUS SYRINGIATUS_

KID OR LAMB IS THUS PREPARED AND SEASONED: TAKE [1] 1 PINT MILK, 4
OUNCES HONEY, 1 OUNCE PEPPER, A LITTLE SALT, A LITTLE LASER, GRAVY [of
the lamb] 8 OUNCES CRUSHED DATES, A SPOONFUL OIL, A LITTLE BROTH, A
SPOONFUL HONEY [2] A PINT OF GOOD WINE AND A LITTLE ROUX.

    [1] Tor.

    [2] G.-V.


[362] THE RAW KID OR LAMB [1]
    _HÆDUS SIVE AGNUS CRUDUS_

IS RUBBED WITH OIL AND PEPPER AND SPRINKLED WITH PLENTY OF CLEAN SALT
AND CORIANDER SEED, PLACED IN THE OVEN, SERVED ROAST.

    [1] It is quite evident that this sentence belongs to
    the preceding formula; but all the texts make a distinct
    separation.


[363] KID OR LAMB À LA TARPEIUS [1]
    _HÆDUM SIVE AGNUM TARPEIANUM_

BEFORE COOKING THE LAMB TRUSS IT PROPERLY AND [marinate it in] PEPPER,
RUE, SATURY, ONIONS, AND A LITTLE THYME AND BROTH. PLACE THE ROAST IN
A PAN WITH OIL, BASTE WELL WHILE IN THE OVEN, WHEN COOKED THOROUGHLY,
FILL THE PAN WITH CRUSHED SATURY, ONIONS, RUE, DATES, BROTH, WINE,
REDUCED WINE, AND OIL; WHEN THIS GRAVY IS WELL COOKED [strain] PUT IT
UP IN A DISH, SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.

    [1] Tor. _Tatarpeianum_. Tarpeius, family name of
    Romans. Humelberg thinks this dish is named for the
    people who dwelled on Mount Tarpeius. This was the
    Tarpeian Rock from which malefactors were thrown.


[364] KID OR LAMB PARTHIAN STYLE
    _HÆDUM SIVE AGNUM PARTHICUM_

PUT [the roast] IN THE OVEN; CRUSH PEPPER, RUE, ONION, SATURY, STONED
DAMASCUS PLUMS, A LITTLE LASER, WINE, BROTH AND OIL. HOT WINE IS
SERVED ON THE SIDE AND TAKEN WITH VINEGAR.


[365] CREAMED KID FLAVORED WITH LAUREL [1]
    _HÆDUM LAUREATUM EX LACTE_

[The kid] DRESS AND PREPARE, BONE, REMOVE THE INTESTINES WITH THE
RENNET AND WASH. PUT IN THE MORTAR PEPPER, LOVAGE, LASER ROOT, 2
LAUREL BERRIES, A LITTLE CHAMOMILE AND 2 OR 3 BRAINS, ALL OF WHICH
CRUSH. MOISTEN WITH BROTH AND SEASON WITH SALT. OVER THIS MIXTURE
STRAIN 2 PINTS [2] OF MILK, 2 LITTLE SPOONS OF HONEY. WITH THIS
FORCEMEAT STUFF THE INTESTINES AND WRAP THEM AROUND THE KID. COVER THE
ROAST WITH CAUL AND PARCHMENT PAPER TIGHTENED WITH SKEWERS, AND PLACE
IT IN THE ROASTING PAN, ADDING BROTH, OIL AND WINE. WHEN HALF DONE,
CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, MOISTEN WITH THE ROAST'S OWN GRAVY AND A LITTLE
REDUCED MUST; PUT THIS BACK INTO THE PAN AND WHEN THE ROAST IS DONE
COMPLETELY GARNISH IT AND BIND [the gravy] WITH ROUX AND SERVE.

    [1] Dann. thinks _laureatus_ stands for the best, the
    prize-winning meat, but the laurel may refer to the
    flavor used.

    List. remarks that cow's milk was very scarce in Italy;
    likewise was goat's and sheep's milk; hence it is
    possible that the kid was cooked with its mother's own
    milk.

    [2] pints--_sextarii_.

PIG
  _IN PORCELLO_


[366] SUCKLING PIG STUFFED TWO WAYS
    _PORCELLUM FARSILEM DUOBUS GENERIBUS_

PREPARE, REMOVE THE ENTRAILS BY THE THROAT BEFORE THE CARCASS HARDENS
[immediately after killing]. MAKE AN OPENING UNDER THE EAR, FILL AN OX
BLADDER WITH TARENTINE [1] SAUSAGE MEAT AND ATTACH A TUBE SUCH AS THE
BIRD KEEPER USES TO THE NECK OF THE BLADDER AND SQUEEZE THE DRESSING
INTO THE EAR AS MUCH AS IT WILL TAKE TO FILL THE BODY. THEN SEAL THE
OPENING WITH PARCHMENT, CLOSE SECURELY [with skewers] AND PREPARE [the
roast for the oven].

    [1] Tor. _impensam Tarentinam_; G.-V. _Terentinam_.

    The birdkeeper's tube may be an instrument for the
    cramming of fowl.

[366a] THE OTHER DRESSING IS MADE THUS:

CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, ORIGANY, LASER ROOT, MOISTEN WITH A LITTLE
BROTH, ADD COOKED BRAINS, RAW EGGS, COOKED SPELT, GRAVY OF THE PIG,
SMALL BIRDS (IF ANY) NUTS, WHOLE PEPPER, AND SEASON WITH BROTH. STUFF
THE PIG, CLOSE THE OPENING WITH PARCHMENT AND SKEWERS AND PUT IT IN
THE OVEN. WHEN DONE, DRESS AND GARNISH VERY NICELY, GLAZE THE BODY
AND SERVE.


[367] ANOTHER SUCKLING PIG
    _ALITER PORCELLUM_

SALT, CUMIN, LASER; ADD SAUSAGE MEAT. DILUTE WITH BROTH [1] REMOVE THE
WOMB OF THE PIG SO THAT NO PART OF IT REMAINS INSIDE. CRUSH PEPPER,
LOVAGE, ORIGANY, MOISTEN WITH BROTH, ADD WINE [2] BRAINS, MIX IN 2
EGGS, FILL THE [previously] PARBOILED PIG WITH THIS FORCEMEAT, CLOSE
TIGHT, PLACE IN A BASKET AND IMMERSE IN THE BOILING STOCK POT. WHEN
DONE REMOVE THE SKEWERS BUT IN A MANNER THAT THE GRAVY REMAINS INSIDE.
SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER, SERVE.

    [1] G.-V. treats the following as a separate article
    under the heading of _porcellum liquaminatum_.

    [2] G.-V. _unum_ (one brain) instead of _uinum_.


[368] STUFFED BOILED SUCKLING PIG
    _PORCELLUM ELIXUM FARSILEM_

REMOVE THE WOMB OF THE PIG. PARBOIL. CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, ORIGANY,
MOISTEN WITH BROTH. ADD COOKED BRAINS, AS MUCH AS IS NEEDED [1]
LIKEWISE DISSOLVE EGGS, [add] BROTH TO TASTE, MAKE A SAUSAGE [of this
forcemeat] FILL THE PIG WHICH HAS BEEN PARBOILED AND RINSED WITH
BROTH. TIE THE PIG SECURELY IN A BASKET, IMMERSE IN THE BOILING STOCK
POT. REMOVE WHEN DONE, WIPE CLEAN CAREFULLY, SERVE WITHOUT PEPPER.

    [1] To have a forcemeat of the right consistency.


[369] ROAST SUCKLING PIG WITH HONEY
    _PORCELLUM ASSUM TRACTOMELINUM_ [1]

EMPTY THE PIG BY THE NECK, CLEAN AND DRY, CRUSH ONE OUNCE PEPPER,
HONEY AND WINE, PLACE [this in a sauce pan and] HEAT; NEXT BREAK DRY
TOAST [2] AND MIX WITH THE THINGS IN THE SAUCE PAN; STIR WITH A WHIP
OF FRESH LAUREL TWIGS [3] SO THAT THE PASTE IS NICE AND SMOOTH UNTIL
SUFFICIENTLY COOKED. THIS DRESSING FILL INTO THE PIG, WRAP IN
PARCHMENT, PLACE IN THE OVEN [roast slowly, when done, glaze with
honey] GARNISH NICELY AND SERVE.

    [1] treated with honey.

    [2] Tor. _tactam siccatam_ for _tractam_.

    [3] Again this very subtle method of flavoring, so often
    referred to. This time it is a laurel whip. Cf. ℞
    Nos. 277 _seq._, 345, 369, 385.


[370] MILK-FED PIG, COLD, APICIAN SAUCE
    _PORCELLUM LACTE PASTUM ELIXUM CALIDUM IURE FRIGIDO CRUDO APICIANO_

SERVE BOILED MILK-FED PIG EITHER HOT OR COLD WITH THIS SAUCE [1] IN A
MORTAR, PUT PEPPER, LOVAGE, CORIANDER SEED, MINT, RUE, AND CRUSH IT.
MOISTEN WITH BROTH. ADD HONEY, WINE AND BROTH. THE BOILED PIG IS WIPED
OFF HOT WITH A CLEAN TOWEL, [cooled off] COVERED WITH THE SAUCE AND
SERVED [2].

    [1] Tor.

    [2] This sentence wanting in Tor.


[371] SUCKLING PIG À LA VITELLIUS [1]
    _PORCELLUM VITELLIANUM_

SUCKLING PIG CALLED VITELLIAN STYLE IS PREPARED THUS [2] GARNISH THE
PIG LIKE WILD BOAR [3] SPRINKLE WITH SALT, ROAST IN OVEN. IN THE
MORTAR PUT PEPPER, LOVAGE, MOISTEN WITH BROTH, WINE AND RAISIN WINE TO
TASTE, PUT THIS IN A SAUCE PAN, ADDING VERY LITTLE OIL, HEAT; THE
ROASTING PIG BASTE WITH THIS IN A MANNER SO THAT [the aroma] WILL
PENETRATE THE SKIN.

    [1] Named for Vitellius, Roman emperor.

    [2] Tor. sentence wanting in other texts.

    [3] i.e. marinated with raw vegetables, wine, spices,
    etc. Cf. ℞ Nos. 329-30.


[372] SUCKLING PIG À LA FLACCUS
    _PORCELLUM FLACCIANUM_ [1]

THE PIG IS GARNISHED LIKE WILD BOAR [2] SPRINKLE WITH SALT, PLACE IN
THE OVEN. WHILE BEING DONE PUT IN THE MORTAR PEPPER, LOVAGE, CARRAWAY,
CELERY SEED, LASER ROOT, GREEN RUE, AND CRUSH IT, MOISTEN WITH BROTH,
WINE AND RAISIN WINE TO TASTE, PUT THIS IN A SAUCE PAN, ADDING A
LITTLE OIL, HEAT, BIND WITH ROUX. THE ROAST PIG, FREE FROM BONES,
SPRINKLE WITH POWDERED CELERY SEED AND SERVE.

    [1] List. named for Flaccus Hordeonius, (_puto_).
    Flaccus was a rather common Roman family name.

    [2] Cf. note 3 to ℞ No. 371, also ℞ Nos. 329-30.
    Lister is thoroughly puzzled by this procedure, but the
    problem is very simple: just treat the pig like wild
    boar.


[373] SUCKLING PIG, LAUREL FLAVOR
    _PORCELLUM LAUREATUM_

THE PIG IS BONED AND GARNISHED WITH A LITTLE WINE SAUCE [1] PARBOIL
WITH GREEN LAUREL IN THE CENTER [2] AND PLACE IT IN THE OVEN TO BE
ROASTED SUFFICIENTLY. MEANWHILE PUT IN THE MORTAR PEPPER, LOVAGE,
CARRAWAY, CELERY SEED, LASER ROOT, AND LAUREL BERRIES, CRUSH THEM,
MOISTEN WITH BROTH, WINE AND RAISIN WINE TO TASTE. [Put this in a
sauce pan and heat] BIND [with roux; untie the pig] REMOVE THE LAUREL
LEAVES; INCORPORATE THE JUICE OF THE BONES [from which a gravy has
been made in the meantime] AND SERVE.

    [1] marinate in the ordinary way with _œnogarum_ as
    the dominant flavor.

    [2] It is presumed that the boned pig is rolled and
    tied, with the leaves in the center.


[374] SUCKLING PIG À LA FRONTO [1]
    _PORCELLUM FRONTINIANUM_

BONE THE PIG, PARBOIL, GARNISH; IN A SAUCE PAN. ADD BROTH, WINE, BIND.
WHEN HALF DONE, ADD A BUNCH OF LEEKS AND DILL, SOME REDUCED MUST. WHEN
COOKED WIPE THE PIG CLEAN, LET IT DRIP OFF; SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER,
SERVE.

    [1] List. Probably named for Julius Fronto, _prætor
    urbanus_ under Vitellius. Cornelius Fronto was an orator
    and author at the time of emperor Hadrian. Cf. ℞ No.
    246. G.-V. Frontinianus.


[375] SUCKLING PIG STEWED IN WINE
    _PORCELLUM ŒNOCOCTUM_ [1]

SCALD [parboil] THE PIG [and] MARINATE [2] PLACE IN A SAUCE PAN [with]
OIL, BROTH, WINE AND WATER, TIE A BUNCH OF LEEKS AND CORIANDER; [cook
(in the oven)] WHEN HALF DONE COLOR WITH REDUCED MUST. IN THE MORTAR
PUT PEPPER, LOVAGE, CARRAWAY, ORIGANY, CELERY SEED, LASER ROOT AND
CRUSH THEM, MOISTEN WITH BROTH, ADD THE PIG'S OWN GRAVY AND RAISIN
WINE TO TASTE. ADD THIS [to the meat in the sauce pan] AND LET IT
BOIL. WHEN BOILING BIND WITH ROUX. THE PIG, PLACED ON A PLATTER, MASK
[with the sauce] SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.

    [1] Tor. _vino elixatus_; G.-V. _œnococtum_.

    [2] It is presumed that the pig is prepared for coction
    as in the foregoing, namely cleaned, washed, boned, etc.
    This also applies to the succeeding recipes of pig.


[376] PIG À LA CELSINUS [1]
    _PORCELLUM CELSINIANUM_

PREPARE [as above] INJECT [the following dressing made of] PEPPER,
RUE, ONIONS, SATURY, THE PIG'S OWN GRAVY [and] EGGS THROUGH THE EAR
[2] AND OF PEPPER, BROTH AND A LITTLE WINE [make a sauce which is
served] IN THE SAUCE BOAT [3]; AND ENJOY IT.

    [1] Tor. _Cæsianus_; Tac. _cesinianum_; G.-V.
    _Celsinianum_. Lister goes far out of his way to prove
    that the man for whom this dish was named was Celsinus.
    He cites a very amusing bit of ancient humor by Petrus
    Lambecius, given below.

    [2] Really a dressing in a liquid state when raw, a
    custard syringed into the carcass, which congeals during
    coction. Eggs must be in proper proportion to the other
    liquids. The pig thus filled is either steamed, roasted
    or baked, well protected by buttered or oiled paper--all
    of which the ancient author failed to state, as a matter
    of course.

    "The Porker's Last Will and Testament"
    by Petrus Lambecius

    (V. Barnab. Brissonium de Formulis lib. VII, p. 677)
    [ex Lister, 1705, p. 196; Lister, 1709, p. 236].

    "I, M. Grunter Corocotta Porker, do hereby make my last
    will and testament. Incapable of writing in my own hand,
    I have dictated what is to be set down:

    "The Chief Cook sayeth: 'Come here, you--who has upset
    this house, you nuissance, you porker! I'll deprive you
    of your life this day!'

    "Corocotta Porker sayeth: 'What, perchance, have I done?
    In what way, please, have I sinned? Have I with my feet
    perhaps smashed your crockery? I beg of you, Mr. Cook, I
    entreat you, if such be the case, kindly grant the
    supplicant a reprieve.'

    "The Chief Cook sayeth: 'Go over there, boy! Fetch me
    from the kitchen that slaughtering-knife. I'm just
    itching to give this porker a blood-bath!'

    "Mr. Porker, realizing that this is the season when
    cabbage sprouts are abundant, and visualizing himself
    potted and peppered, and furthermore seeing that death
    is inevitable, asks for time and begs of the cook
    whether it was possible to make a will. This granted, he
    calls out with a loud voice to his parents to save for
    them the food that was to have been his own in the
    future, to wit:

    "To my father, Mr. Genuine Bacon-Fat, appointed by me
    in my last will I give and bequeath: thirty measures of
    acorns; and to my mother, Mrs. Old-Timer Sow, appointed
    by me in my last will, I give and bequeath: forty
    measures of Spartan wheat; and to my sister, Cry-Baby,
    appointed by me in my last will, whose wedding, alas! I
    cannot attend, I give and bequeath: thirty measures of
    barley; and of my nobler parts and property I give and
    bequeath, to the cobbler: my bristles; to the brawlers,
    my jaw-bones; to the deaf, my ears; to the shyster
    lawyers, my tongue; to the cow-herds, my intestines; to
    the sausage makers, my thighs; to the ladies, my
    tenderloins; to the boys, my bladder; to the girls, my
    little pig's tail; to the dancers, my muscles; to the
    runners and hunters, my knuckles; to the hired man, my
    hoofs; and to the cook--though not to be named--I give
    and bequeath and transmit my belly and appendage which I
    have dragged with me from the rotten oak bottoms to the
    pig's sty, for him to tie around his neck and to hang
    himself with.

    "I wish to erect a monument to myself, inscribed with
    golden letters: 'M. Grunter Corocotta Porker lived
    nine-hundred-and-ninety-nine years, and had he lived
    another half year, a thousand years would have been
    nearly completed.'

    "I ask of you who love me best, you who live like me, I
    ask you: will not my name remain to be eulogized in all
    eternity? if you only will prepare my body properly and
    flavor it well with good condiments, nuts, pepper and
    honey!

    "My master and my relatives, all of you who have
    witnessed this execution of my last will and testament,
    you are requested to sign.

    "(Signed) Hard Sausage
              Match Maker
              Fat Bacon
              Bacon Rind
              Celsinus
              Meat Ball
              Sprout Cabbage."

       *       *       *       *       *

Thus far the story by Petrus Lambecius. The fifth of the signatories of
the Porker's Testament is Celsinus; and since the other names are
fictitious it is quite possible that Lambecius had a special purpose in
pointing out the man for whom the dish, Porcellus Celsinianus,--Suckling
Pig à la Celsinus--was named.

Celsinus was counsellor for Aurelianus, the emperor.


[377] ROAST PIG
    _PORCELLUM ASSUM_

CRUSH PEPPER, RUE, SATURY, ONIONS, HARD YOLKS OF EGG, BROTH, WINE,
OIL, SPICES; BOIL THESE INGREDIENTS, POUR OVER THE [roast] PIG IN THE
SAUCE PAN AND SERVE.


[378] PIG À LA JARDINIÈRE
    _PORCELLUM HORTOLANUM_ [1]

THE PIG IS BONED THROUGH THE THROAT AND FILLED WITH QUENELLES OF
CHICKEN FORCEMEAT, FINELY CUT [roast] THRUSHES, FIG-PECKERS, LITTLE
SAUSAGE CAKES, MADE OF THE PIG'S MEAT, LUCANIAN SAUSAGE, STONED DATES,
EDIBLE BULBS [glazed onions] SNAILS TAKEN OUT OF THE SHELL [and
poached] MALLOWS, LEEKS, BEETS, CELERY, COOKED SPROUTS, CORIANDER,
WHOLE PEPPER, NUTS, 15 EGGS POURED OVER, BROTH, WHICH IS SPICED WITH
PEPPER, AND DILUTED WITH 3 EGGS; THEREUPON SEW IT TIGHT, STIFFEN, AND
ROAST IN THE OVEN. WHEN DONE, OPEN THE BACK [of the pig] AND POUR OVER
THE FOLLOWING SAUCE: CRUSHED PEPPER, RUE, BROTH, RAISIN WINE, HONEY
AND A LITTLE OIL, WHICH WHEN BOILING IS TIED WITH ROUX [2].

    [1] Tor. _Hortulanus_; Gardener's style, the French
    equivalent _Jardinière_, a very common name for all
    dishes containing young vegetables. However, in the
    above rich formula there is very little to remind us of
    the gardener's style, excepting the last part of the
    formula, enumerating a number of fresh vegetables. It is
    unthinkable for any gourmet to incorporate these with
    the rich dressing. The vegetables should be used as a
    garnish for the finished roast. This leads us to believe
    that the above is really two distinct formulæ, or that
    the vegetables were intended for garniture.

    [2] This extraordinary and rich dressing, perfectly
    feasible and admirable when compared with our own
    "Toulouse," "Financière," "Chipolata," can be palatable
    only when each component part is cooked separately
    before being put into the pig. The eggs must be whipped
    and diluted with broth and poured over the filling to
    serve as binder. The pig must be parboiled before
    filling, and the final cooking or roasting must be done
    very slowly and carefully--procedure not stated by the
    original which it takes for granted.

HARE
  _LEPOREM_


[382] BRAISED HARE
    _LEPOREM MADIDUM_

IS PARBOILED A LITTLE IN WATER, THEREUPON PLACE IT ON A ROASTING PAN
WITH OIL, TO BE ROASTED IN THE OVEN. AND WHEN PROPERLY DONE, WITH A
CHANGE OF OIL, IMMERSE IT IN THE FOLLOWING GRAVY: CRUSH PEPPER,
SATURY, ONION, RUE, CELERY SEED; MOISTEN WITH BROTH, LASER, WINE, AND
A LITTLE OIL. WHILE THE ROASTING [of the hare] IS BEING COMPLETED IT
IS SEVERAL TIMES BASTED WITH THE GRAVY.

    Wanting in Goll.

    A difference in the literary style from the foregoing is
    quite noticeable.


[383] THE SAME, WITH A DIFFERENT DRESSING
    _ITEM ALIA AD EUM IMPENSAM_

[The hare] MUST BE PROPERLY KEPT [i.e. aged for a few days after
killing]. CRUSH PEPPER, DATES, LASER, RAISINS, REDUCED WINE, BROTH AND
OIL; DEPOSIT [the hare in this preparation to be cooked] WHEN DONE,
SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.

    Wanting in Goll. Tor. continuing without interruption.


[384] STUFFED HARE
    _LEPOREM FARSUM_

WHOLE [pine] NUTS, ALMONDS, CHOPPED NUTS OR BEECHNUTS, WHOLE PEPPER
ARE MIXED WITH THE [force] MEAT OF HARE THICKENED WITH EGGS AND
WRAPPED IN PIG'S CAUL TO BE ROASTED IN THE OVEN [1]. ANOTHER FORCEMEAT
IS MADE WITH RUE, PLENTY OF PEPPER, ONION, SATURY, DATES, BROTH,
REDUCED WINE, OR SPICED WINE. THIS IS REDUCED TO THE PROPER
CONSISTENCY AND IS LAID UNDER; BUT THE HARE REMAINS IN THE BROTH
FLAVORED WITH LASER.

    [1] Reminding of the popular meat loaf, made of
    remnants: _Falscher Hase_, "Imitation Hare," as it is
    known on the Continent.

    The ancients probably used the trimmings of hare and
    other meat for this forcemeat, or meat loaf, either to
    stuff the hare with, or to make a meal of the
    preparation itself, as indicated above.

    We also recall that the ancients had ingenious baking
    moulds of metal in the shape of hares and other animals.
    These moulds, no doubt, were used for baking or the
    serving of preparations of this sort. The absence of
    table forks and cutlery as is used today made such
    preparations very appropriate and convenient in
    leisurely dining.


[385] WHITE SAUCE FOR HARE
    _IUS ALBUM IN ASSUM LEPOREM_

PEPPER, LOVAGE, CUMIN, CELERY SEED, HARD BOILED YOLKS, PROPERLY
POUNDED, MADE INTO A PASTE. IN A SAUCE PAN BOIL BROTH, WINE, OIL, A
LITTLE VINEGAR AND CHOPPED ONIONS. WHILE BOILING ADD THE PASTE OF
SPICES, STIRRING WITH A FAGOT OF ORIGANY OR SATURY [1] AND WHEN THE
WORK IS DONE, BIND IT WITH ROUX.

    [1] Fagots, or whips made of different herbs and brushes
    are often employed by Apicius, a very subtle device to
    impart faint flavors to sauces. The custom has been in
    use for ages. With the return of mixed drinks in America
    it was revived by the use of cinnamon sticks with which
    to stir the drinks.

    The above hare formulæ are wanting in Goll.


[386] LIGHTS OF HARE [1]
    _ALITER IN LEPOREM_ [2]

A FINE HASH OF HARE'S BLOOD, LIVER AND LUNGS. PUT INTO A SAUCE PAN
BROTH AND OIL, AND LET IT BOIL WITH FINELY CHOPPED LEEKS AND
CORIANDER; NOW ADD THE LIVERS AND LUNGS, AND, WHEN DONE, CRUSH PEPPER,
CUMIN, CORIANDER, LASER ROOT, MINT, RUE, FLEA-BANE, MOISTENED WITH
VINEGAR [3].

    [1] Wanting in Goll.

    [2] Tor. _Condimentum ex visceribus leporinis_.

    [3] The various texts combine the above and the
    following formula; but we are of the opinion that they
    are two distinct preparations.


[387] LIGHTS OF HARE, ANOTHER WAY
    _ALITER_

TO THE HARE'S LIVER ADD THE BLOOD AND POUND IT WITH HONEY AND SOME OF
THE HARE'S OWN GRAVY; ADD VINEGAR TO TASTE AND PUT IN A SAUCE PAN, ADD
THE LUNGS CHOPPED FINE, MAKE IT BOIL: WHEN DONE BIND WITH ROUX,
SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.

    This and the preceding formula resemble closely our
    purées or forcemeats of livers of game and fowl, which
    are spread on croutons to accompany the roast.


[388] HARE IN ITS OWN BROTH [1]
    _ALITER LEPOREM EX SUO IURE_

PREPARE THE HARE, BONE IT, GARNISH [2] PUT IT IN A STEW POT [3] AND
WHEN HALF DONE ADD A SMALL BUNCH OF LEEKS, CORIANDER, DILL; WHILE THIS
IS BEING DONE, PUT IN THE MORTAR PEPPER, LOVAGE, CUMIN, CORIANDER
SEED, LASER ROOT, DRY ONION, MINT, RUE, CELERY SEED; CRUSH, MOISTEN
WITH BROTH, ADD HONEY, THE HARE'S OWN GRAVY, REDUCED MUST AND VINEGAR
TO TASTE; LET IT BOIL, TIE WITH ROUX, DRESS, GARNISH THE ROAST ON A
PLATTER, UNDERLAY THE SAUCE, SPRINKLE AND SERVE.

    [1] Cf. Goll. ℞ No. 381.

    [2] with vegetables for braising, possibly larding.

    [3] _braisière_, for this is plainly a "potroast" of
    hare. The boned carcass should be tied; this is perhaps
    meant by or is included in _ornas_--garnish, i.e.
    getting ready for braising.


[389] HARE À LA PASSENIANUS [1]
    _LEPOREM PASSENIANUM_

THE HARE IS DRESSED, BONED, THE BODY SPREAD OUT [2] GARNISHED [with
pickling herbs and spices] AND HUNG INTO THE SMOKE STACK [3] WHEN IT
HAS TAKEN ON COLOR, COOK IT HALF DONE, WASH IT, SPRINKLE WITH SALT AND
IMMERSE IT IN WINE SAUCE. IN THE MORTAR PUT PEPPER, LOVAGE, AND CRUSH:
MOISTEN WITH BROTH, WINE AND A LITTLE OIL, HEAT; WHEN BOILING, BIND
WITH ROUX. NOW DETACH THE SADDLE OF THE ROAST HARE, SPRINKLE WITH
PEPPER AND SERVE.

    [1] This personage, Passenius, or Passenianus, is not
    identified.

    [2] To bone the carcass, it usually is opened in the
    back, flattened out and all the bones are easily
    removed. In that state it is easily pickled and
    thoroughly smoked.

    [3] Lan., Tac., and Tor. _suspendes ad furnum_; Hum.,
    List., and G.-V. _... ad fumum_. We accept the latter
    reading, "in the smoke," assuming that _furnum_ is a
    typographical error in Lan. and his successors, Tac. and
    Tor. Still, roasts have for ages been "hung on chains
    close to or above the open fire"; Torinus may not be
    wrong, after all, in this essential direction. However,
    a boned and flattened-out hare would be better broiled
    on the grill than hung up over the open fire.


[390] KROMESKIS OF HARE
    _LEPOREM ISICIATUM_

THE HARE IS COOKED AND FLAVORED IN THE SAME [above] MANNER; SMALL BITS
OF MEAT ARE MIXED WITH SOAKED NUTS; THIS [salpicon] [1] IS WRAPPED IN
CAUL OR PARCHMENT, THE ENDS BEING CLOSED BY MEANS OF SKEWERS [and
fried].

    [1] We call this preparation a salpicon because it
    closely resembles to our modern salpicons--a fine mince
    of meats, mushrooms, etc., although the ancient formula
    fails to state the binder of this mince--either eggs or
    a thickened sauce, or both.


[391] STUFFED HARE
    _LEPOREM FARSILEM_

DRESS THE HARE [as usual] GARNISH [marinate] IT, PLACE IN A SQUARE PAN
[1]. IN THE MORTAR PUT PEPPER, LOVAGE, ORIGANY, MOISTEN WITH BROTH,
ADD CHICKEN LIVERS [sauté] COOKED BRAINS, FINELY CUT MEAT [2] 3 RAW
EGGS, BROTH TO TASTE. WRAP IT IN CAUL OR PARCHMENT, FASTEN WITH
SKEWERS. HALF ROAST ON A SLOW FIRE. [Meanwhile] PUT IN THE MORTAR
PEPPER, LOVAGE: CRUSH AND MOISTEN WITH BROTH, WINE, SEASON, MAKE IT
HOT, WHEN BOILING BIND WITH ROUX; THE HALF-DONE HARE IMMERSE [finish
its cooking in this broth] SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.

    [1] _Quadratum imponis_, which is plain enough. The hare
    is to be roast therein. Dann. Cut in dice; Goll. Spread
    it out. Cf. illustration of square roast pan.

    [2] Presumably the trimmings of the hare or of pork.
    This forcemeat is supposed to be used for the stuffing
    of the hare; it, being boned, is rolled up, the
    forcemeat inside, the outside covered with caul or
    paper, fastened with skewers. Danneil's interpretation
    suggests the thought that the raw hare's meat is cut
    into squares which are filled with forcemeat, rolled,
    wrapped, and roast--a roulade of hare in the regular
    term.


[392] BOILED HARE
    _ALITER LEPOREM ELIXUM_

DRESS THE HARE; [boil it]. IN A FLAT SAUCE PAN POUR OIL, BROTH,
VINEGAR, RAISIN WINE, SLICED ONION, GREEN RUE AND CHOPPED THYME [a
sauce which is served on the side] AND SO SERVE IT.

    Tor. continuing without interruption.


[393] SPICED SAUCE FOR HARE
    _LEPORIS CONDITURA_

CRUSH PEPPER, RUE, ONIONS, THE HARE'S LIVER, BROTH, REDUCED WINE,
RAISIN WINE, A LITTLE OIL; BIND WITH RUE WHEN BOILING.

    Tor. _id._


[394] SPRINKLED HARE
    _LEPOREM (PIPERE) SICCO SPARSUM_ [1]

DRESS THE HARE AS FOR KID À LA TARPEIUS [℞ No. 363]. BEFORE COOKING
DECORATE IT NICELY [2]. SEASON WITH PEPPER, RUE, SATURY, ONION, LITTLE
THYME, MOISTEN WITH BROTH, ROAST IN THE OVEN; AND ALL OVER SPRINKLE
HALF AN OUNCE OF PEPPER, RUE, ONIONS, SATURY, 4 DATES, AND RAISINS.
THE GRAVY IS GIVEN PLENTY OF COLOR OVER THE OPEN FIRE, AND IS SEASONED
WITH WINE, OIL, BROTH, REDUCED WINE, FREQUENTLY STIRRING IT [basting
the hare] SO THAT IT MAY ABSORB ALL THE FLAVOR. AFTER THAT SERVE IT
IN A ROUND DISH WITH DRY PEPPER.

    [1] Tac., Tor. _succo sparsum_.

    [2] We have no proof that the ancients used the larding
    needle as we do (or did) in our days. "Decorate" may,
    therefore, also mean "garnish," i.e. marinate the meat
    in a generous variety of spices, herbs, roots and wine.
    It is noteworthy that this term, "garnish," used here
    and in the preceding formulæ has survived in the
    terminology of the kitchen to this day, in that very
    sense.


[395] SPICED HARE
    _ALITER LEPOREM CONDITUM_

[The well-prepared hare] COOK IN WINE, BROTH, WATER, WITH A LITTLE
MUSTARD [seed], DILL AND LEEKS WITH THE ROOTS. WHEN ALL IS DONE,
SEASON WITH PEPPER, SATURY, ROUND ONIONS, DAMASCUS PLUMS, WINE, BROTH,
REDUCED WINE AND A LITTLE OIL; TIE WITH ROUX, LET BOIL A LITTLE LONGER
[baste] SO THAT THE HARE IS PENETRATED BY THE FLAVOR, AND SERVE IT ON
A PLATTER MASKED WITH SAUCE.

DORMICE
  _GLIRES_


[396] STUFFED DORMOUSE [1]
    _GLIRES_

IS STUFFED WITH A FORCEMEAT OF PORK AND SMALL PIECES OF DORMOUSE MEAT
TRIMMINGS, ALL POUNDED WITH PEPPER, NUTS, LASER, BROTH. PUT THE
DORMOUSE THUS STUFFED IN AN EARTHEN CASSEROLE, ROAST IT IN THE OVEN,
OR BOIL IT IN THE STOCK POT.

    [1] _Glis_, dormouse, a special favorite of the
    ancients, has nothing to do with mice. The fat dormouse
    of the South of Europe is the size of a rat, arboreal
    rodent, living in trees.

    Galen, III, de Alim.; Plinius, VIII, 57/82; Varro, III,
    describing the _glirarium_, place where the dormouse was
    raised for the table.

    Petronius, Cap. 31, describes another way of preparing
    dormouse. Nonnus, Diæteticon, p. 194/5, says that
    Fluvius Hirpinus was the first man to raise dormouse in
    the _glirarium_.

    Dormouse, as an article of diet, should not astonish
    Americans who relish squirrel, opossum, muskrat, "coon,"
    etc.

    _IN TORPEDINE_

CRUSH PEPPER, RUE, SHALLOTS, [adding] HONEY, BROTH, RAISIN WINE, A
LITTLE WINE, ALSO A FEW DROPS OF OIL; WHEN IT COMMENCES TO BOIL, BIND

RAISIN WINE. WINE, AND OIL. IF YOU WISH, ADD MUSTARD AND VINEGAR, OR,
IF DESIRED RICHER, ADD RAISINS.

    This appears to be a sauce to be poured over the boiled
    ray.

    Today the ray is boiled in water seasoned strongly and
    with similar ingredients. When done, the fish is allowed
    to cool in this water; the edible parts are then
    removed, the water drained from the meat, which is
    tossed in sizzling brown butter with lemon juice,
    vinegar and capers. This is _raie au beurre noir_, much
    esteemed on the French seaboards.

    The above formula appears to be a sort of oyster stew.

[411] ALL KINDS OF BIVALVES
    _IN OMNE GENUS CONCHYLIORUM_ [1]

FOR ALL KINDS OF SHELLFISH USE PEPPER, LOVAGE, PARSLEY, DRY MINT, A
LITTLE MORE OF CUMIN, HONEY, AND BROTH; IF YOU WISH, ADD [bay] LEAVES
AND MALOBATHRON [2].

    [1] Wanting in the Vat. Ms.

    [2] Cf. note to ℞ No. 399.

    The shellfish is cooked or steamed with the above
    ingredients.

SEA URCHINS
  _IN ECHINO_


[412] SEA URCHIN
    _IN ECHINO_

TO PREPARE SEA URCHIN TAKE A NEW EARTHEN POT, A LITTLE OIL, BROTH,
SWEET WINE, GROUND PEPPER, AND SET IT TO HEAT; WHEN BOILING PUT THE
URCHINS IN SINGLY. SHAKE THEM WELL, LET THEM STEW, AND WHEN DONE
SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.

    Plinius states that only a few small parts of the sea
    urchin are edible.


[413] ANOTHER METHOD
    _ALITER [IN] ECHINO_

PEPPER, A LITTLE COSTMARY, DRY MINT, MEAD, BROTH, INDIAN SPIKENARD,
AND [bay or nard] LEAVES.


[414] PLAIN BOILED
    _ALITER_

PUT THE SEA URCHINS SINGLY IN BOILING WATER, COOK, RETIRE, AND PLACE
ON A PLATTER.


[415] IN CHAFING DISH
    _IN THERMOSPODIO_ [1]

[To the meat of sea urchins, cooked as above, add a sauce made of bay]
LEAVES, PEPPER, HONEY, BROTH, A LITTLE OIL, BIND WITH EGGS IN THE HOT
WATER BATH [2] SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.

    [1] This formula is combined with the preceding in the
    original.

    [2] Thermospodium; in this respect resembling seafood à
    la Newburgh. The thermospodium is an elaborate food and
    drink heater, used both in the kitchen and in the dining
    room. Our drawing illustrates an elaborate specimen
    which was used to prepare dishes such as this one in
    front of the guests.


[416] SALT SEA URCHIN
    _IN ECHINO SALSO_

[The cooked meat of] SALT SEA URCHIN IS SERVED UP WITH THE BEST [fish]
BROTH, REDUCED WINE AND PEPPER TO TASTE.

    Undoubtedly a commercial article like crabmeat today.
    The sea urchins were cooked at the fisheries, picked,
    shells, refuse discarded, the meat salted and marketed.
    The fish was also salted in the shell as seen in the
    following:


[417] ANOTHER WAY
    _ALITER_

TAKE SALT SEA URCHINS, ADD THE BEST BROTH AND TREAT THEM IN A MANNER
AS TO LOOK LIKE FRESH THAT HAVE JUST COME OUT OF THE WATER.

[418] MUSSELS
    _IN MITULIS_

BEST [2] BROTH, FINELY CUT LEEKS, CUMIN, RAISIN WINE, MUST [3] AND ADD
WATER TO MAKE A MIXTURE IN WHICH TO COOK THE MUSSELS.

    [1] Variously spelled _mytilus_, _mitylus_, _mutulus_,
    an edible mussel.

    Tor. and List. _merula_, merling, whiting, Fr. _merlan_.
    _Merula_ also is a blackbird, which is out of place here.
    The Vat. Ms. reads _in metulis_.

SARDINES, BABY TUNNY, MULLET
  _IN SARDA _[1]_ CORDULA _[2]_ MUGILE_ [3]


[419] STUFFED SARDINE
    _SARDAM FARSILEM_

PROPERLY, OUGHT TO BE TREATED IN THIS MANNER: THE SARDINE IS BONED AND
FILLED WITH CRUSHED FLEA-BANE, SEVERAL GRAINS OF PEPPER, MINT, NUTS,
DILUTED WITH HONEY, TIED OR SEWED, WRAPPED IN PARCHMENT AND PLACED IN
A FLAT DISH ABOVE THE STEAM RISING FROM THE STOVE; SEASON WITH OIL,
REDUCED MUST AND ORIGANY [4].

    [1] The freshly caught sardine.

    [2] _Cordyla_, _cordilla_, the young or the fry of
    tunny.

    [3] _Mugil_, sea-mullet.

    [4] Tor. origany; List. _alece_, with brine.


[420] ANOTHER PREPARATION OF SARDINES
    _SARDA ITA FIT_

COOK AND BONE THE SARDINES; FILL WITH CRUSHED PEPPER, LOVAGE, THYME,
ORIGANY, RUE, MOISTENED WITH DATE WINE, HONEY; PLACE ON A DISH,
GARNISH WITH CUT HARD EGGS. POUR OVER A LITTLE WINE, VINEGAR, REDUCED
MUST, AND VIRGIN OIL.


[421] SAUCE FOR SARDINES
    _IUS IN SARDA_

PEPPER, ORIGANY, MINT, ONIONS, A LITTLE VINEGAR, AND OIL.

    Resembling our _vinaigrette_.


[422] ANOTHER SAUCE FOR SARDINES [1]
    _IUS ALIUD IN SARDA_

PEPPER, LOVAGE, DRY MINT [2] COOKED, ONION [chopped], HONEY, VINEGAR,
DILUTE WITH OIL, SPRINKLE WITH CHOPPED HARD EGGS.

    [1] Another _Vinaigrette_.

    [2] Tac. and Tor. _mentam aridam coctam_, dry mint
    cooked, which is reasonable, to soften it. Hum., G.-V.
    dry mint, cooked onion; there is no necessity to cook
    the onion. As a matter of fact, it should be chopped raw
    in this dressing. The onion is wanting in Tac. and Tor.


[423] SAUCE FOR BROILED BABY TUNNY
    _IUS IN CORDULA ASSA_

PEPPER, LOVAGE, CELERY SEED, MINT, RUE, FIGDATE [or its wine] HONEY,
VINEGAR, WINE. ALSO SUITABLE FOR SARDINES.


[424] SAUCE FOR SALT SEA-MULLET
    _IUS IN MUGILE SALSO_

PEPPER, LOVAGE, CUMIN, ONION, MINT, RUE, SAGE [1], DATE WINE, HONEY,
VINEGAR, MUSTARD AND OIL.

    [1] Tor. _calva_; G.-V. _calvam_. Does not exist. Hum.

[425] ANOTHER SAUCE FOR SALT SEA-MULLET
    _ALITER IUS IN MUGILE SALSO_

PEPPER, ORIGANY, ROCKET, MINT, RUE, SAGE [1], DATE WINE, HONEY, OIL,
VINEGAR AND MUSTARD.

    [1] Same as above.



XI [1]


[426] SAUCE FOR CATFISH, BABY TUNNY AND TUNNY
    _IUS IN SILURO _[2]_ IN PELAMYDE _[3]_ ET IN THYNNO_ [4]

TO MAKE THEM MORE TASTY USE [5] PEPPER, LOVAGE, CUMIN, ONIONS, MINT,
RUE, SAGE [6] DATE WINE, HONEY, VINEGAR, MUSTARD AND OIL.

    [1] The twelve chapters of Book IX, as shown in the
    beginning of the text are here increased to fourteen by
    G.-V., to wit, XII, _IUS IN MULLO TARICHO_ and XIII,
    _SALSUM SINE SALSO_, but these are more properly
    included in the above chapter XI, as does Tor. All of
    the above fish were salt, and probably were important
    commercial articles. The _silurus_, for instance, is
    best in the river Danube in the Balkans, while the red
    mullet, as seen in ℞ No. 427 came from the sea of
    Galilee. Cf. ℞ Nos. 144, 149.

    [2] _Silurus_, probably the sly silurus, or sheatfish,
    in the U. S. called horn-pout--a large catfish.

    [3] _Pelamis_, a tunny before it is a year old.

    [4] Tunny, Tunafish.

    [5] Tor. wanting in the others.

    [6] Cf. note 1 to ℞ No. 424.



XII


[427] SAUCE FOR SALT RED MULLET
    _IUS IN MULLO _[1]_ TARICHO_ [2]

IF IN NEED OF CONDIMENTS USE [3] PEPPER, RUE, ONIONS, DATES, GROUND
MUSTARD; MIX ALL WITH [flaked meat of] SEA URCHINS, MOISTEN WITH OIL,
AND POUR OVER THE FISH WHICH IS EITHER FRIED OR BROILED, OMITTING SALT
[4].

    [1] Tor. _mulo_, the red sur-mullet--a very esteemed
    fish.

    [2] Tarichea, town of Galilee, on the sea of Galilee.
    Salt mullet as prepared at Tarichea was known as
    _Tarichus_. This became finally a generic name for all
    kinds of salt fish, whether coming from Tarichea or from
    elsewhere. We have an interesting analogy in "Finnan
    Haddie," smoked Haddock from Findon, Scotland, corrupted
    into "Finnan," and now used for any kind of smoked
    Haddock. Cf. ℞ Nos. 144, 149.

    [3] Tor. Quite correctly, he questions the need of
    condiments for salt fish.

    [4] List. uses this last sentence as the title for the
    next formula, implying that more salt be added to the
    salt fish; Tor. is explicit in saying that no salt be
    added which of course, is correct.



XIII

ANOTHER WAY, WITHOUT SALT [PORK?]
  _ALITER, SINE SALSO_ [1]


[428] FISH LIVER PUDDING
    _SALSUM, SINE SALSO_ [2]

COOK THE LIVER [of the mullet] CRUSH [3] AND ADD PEPPER, EITHER BROTH
OR SALT [4] ADD OIL, LIVER OF HARE, OR OF LAMB [5] OR OF CHICKEN, AND,
IF YOU LIKE, PRESS INTO A FISH MOULD [6] [unmould, after baking]
SPRINKLE WITH VIRGIN OIL [7].

    [1] Tor.

    [2] G.-V. plainly, a contradiction. The possible meaning
    may be, "Salt Fish, without salt pork" as salt fish is
    frequently served with bacon.

    [3] Dann. Crush the liver, which is probably correct. A
    paste or forcemeat of the livers and fish were made.

    [4] The addition of salt would be superfluous if the
    liver of salt meat is used, excepting if the liver of
    hare, etc., predominated.

    [5] G.-V. or liver of kid, wanting in Tor.

    [6] Such fish-shape moulds existed, made of bronze,
    artistically finished, same as we possess them today;
    such moulds were made in various styles and shapes. Cf.
    ℞ No. 384.

    [7] This is an attempt to make a "fish" of livers, not
    so much with the intention to deceive as to utilize the
    livers in an attractive way. A very nutritious dish and
    a most ingenious device, requiring much skill.

    This is another good example of Roman cookery, far from
    being extravagant as it is reputed to be, it is
    economical and clever, and shows ingenuity in the
    utilization of good things which are often discarded as
    worthless.


[429] ANOTHER WAY, FOR A CHANGE!
    _ALITER VICEM GERENS SALSI_ [1]

CUMIN, PEPPER, BROTH, WHICH CRUSH, ADDING A LITTLE RAISIN WINE, OR
REDUCED WINE, AND A QUANTITY OF CRUSHED NUTS. MIX EVERYTHING WELL,
INCORPORATE WITH THE SALT [2] [fish]; MIX IN A LITTLE OIL AND SERVE.

    [1] G.-V. _Alter vice salsi_.

    [2] Tor. _& salibus imbue_; List. _& salsa redde_. There
    is no sense to Lister's version, nor can we accept G.-V.
    who have _et salari defundes_.


[430] ANOTHER WAY
    _ALITER SALSUM IN _[1]_ SALSO_

TAKE AS MUCH CUMIN AS YOUR FIVE FINGERS WILL HOLD; CRUSH HALF OF THAT
QUANTITY OF PEPPER AND ONE PIECE OF PEELED GARLIC, MOISTEN WITH BROTH
AND MIX IN A LITTLE OIL. THIS WILL CORRECT AND BENEFIT A SOUR STOMACH
AND PROMOTE DIGESTION [2].

    [1] Tor., G.-V. _sine_.

    [2] The title has reference to salt fish or salt pork;
    but the formula obviously is of a medicinal character
    and has no place here.



XII [XIV]


[431] BAIAN SEAFOOD STEW
    _EMBRACTUM _[1]_ BAIANUM_ [2]

MINCED [poached] OYSTERS, MUSSELS [3] [or scallops] AND SEA NETTLES
PUT IN A SAUCE PAN WITH TOASTED NUTS, RUE, CELERY, PEPPER, CORIANDER,
CUMIN, RAISIN WINE, BROTH, REDUCED WINE AND OIL.

    [1] List. _emphractum_--a caudle, a stew. Seafood stews
    of this sort are very popular in the South of Europe,
    the most famous among them being the _Bouillabaisse_ of
    Marseilles.

    [2] Baiæ, a very popular seaside resort of the ancients
    located in the bay of Naples. The stew was named after
    the place. Horace liked the place but Seneca warned
    against it.

    [3] Tor. _spondylos_; List. _sphondylos_--scallops.
    Both terms, if used in connection with the shellfish are
    correct. Lister in several places confuses this term
    with _spongiolus_--mushroom. This instance is the final
    vindication of Torinus, whose correctness was maintained
    in ℞ Nos. 41, 47, 115, _seq._; 120, 121, 183, 309,
    _seq._


END OF BOOK IX [1]

_EXPLICIT APICII THALASSA LIBER NONUS_ [2]


    [1] It appears to us that Book IX and the following,
    Book X, judging from its recipes, phraseology and from
    other appearances is by a different author than the
    preceding books. (Long after having made this
    observation, we learn from Vollmer, Studien, that Books
    IX and X were missing in the Archetypus Fuldensis.)

[432] A SAUCE FINES HERBES FOR FRIED FISH
    _IUS DIABOTANON _[2]_ PRO _[3]_ PISCE FRIXO_

USE ANY KIND OF FISH. PREPARE [clean, salt, turn in flour] SALT [4]
AND FRY IT. CRUSH PEPPER, CUMIN, CORIANDER SEED, LASER ROOT, ORIGANY,
AND RUE, ALL CRUSHED FINE, MOISTENED WITH VINEGAR, DATE WINE, HONEY,
REDUCED MUST, OIL AND BROTH. POUR IN A SAUCE PAN, PLACE ON FIRE, WHEN
SIMMERING POUR OVER THE FRIED FISH, SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.

    [1] This chapter principally deals with fish sauces.
    Apparently it is by a different author than Books
    I-VIII, which have many formulæ for fish. While we have
    no direct proof, we are inclined to believe that Book X
    is a Roman version of a Greek treatise on fish sauces, a
    monograph, of which there existed many, according to
    Athenæus, which specialized on the various departments
    of cookery.

    [2] Tor. _Diabotom_ (in Greek characters); Greek,
    relating to herbs.

    [3] Tor. G.-V. _in_.

    [4] G.-V. _salsas_.


[433] SAUCE FOR BOILED FISH
    _IUS IN PISCE ELIXO_

PEPPER, LOVAGE, CUMIN, SMALL ONIONS, ORIGANY, NUTS, FIGDATES, HONEY,
VINEGAR, BROTH, MUSTARD, A LITTLE OIL; HEAT THIS SAUCE, AND IF YOU
WISH [it to be richer, add] RAISINS.


[434] ANOTHER SAUCE FOR BOILED FISH
    _ALITER IN PISCE ELIXO_ [1]

CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, GREEN CORIANDER, SATURY, ONION, [hard] BOILED
YOLKS, RAISIN WINE, VINEGAR, OIL AND BROTH.

    [1] Tor. _frixo_--fried fish, although his heading reads
    _elixo_.


[435] ANOTHER SAUCE FOR BOILED FISH
    _ALITER IUS IN PISCE ELIXO_

PREPARE THE FISH CAREFULLY; IN THE MORTAR PUT SALT, CORIANDER SEED,
CRUSH AND MIX WELL; TURN THE FISH THEREIN, PUT IT IN A PAN, COVER IT
AND SEAL IT WITH PLASTER [1] COOK IT IN THE OVEN. WHEN DONE RETIRE
[the fish from the pan] SPRINKLE WITH STRONG VINEGAR AND SERVE.

    [1] Remarkable culinary ingenuity, resembling in
    principle the North American Indian method of cooking
    whitefish wrapped in clay. Today we use flour and water
    made into a stiff paste to seal a pan hermetically if no
    "pressure cooker" is available.

    This formula cannot be classified under "Sauce for
    Boiled Fish."


[436] ANOTHER SAUCE FOR BOILED FISH
    _ALITER IUS IN PISCE ELIXO_

WHEN THE FISH IS PREPARED, PUT THE SAME IN A FLAT PAN WITH CORIANDER
SEED, WATER AND GREEN DILL; WHEN COOKED SPRINKLE WITH VINEGAR AND
SERVE [1].

    [1] Another fair example of the incompleteness, on the
    one hand, of the directions, and of the superfluity, on
    the other hand, of words such as the initial and the
    closing words, which characterizes so many of the
    formulæ. This is characteristic of ever so many culinary
    authors of all ages, who, lacking literary training,
    assume that the reader is thoroughly versed with the
    methods indicated. A versatile modern author would have
    said: "Poach the filleted fish in small water seasoned
    with coriander seed and green dill; sprinkle with
    vinegar before serving." He mentioned neither the salt
    nor the oil which he undoubtedly used.


[437] ALEXANDRINE [1] SAUCE FOR BROILED FISH
    _IUS ALEXANDRINUM IN PISCE ASSO_

PEPPER, DRY ONIONS [shallots] LOVAGE, CUMIN, ORIGANY, CELERY SEED,
STONED DAMASCUS PRUNES [pounded in the mortar] FILLED UP [2] WITH
VINEGAR, BROTH, REDUCED MUST, AND OIL, AND COOK IT.

    [1] Alexandria, Egyptian city, at the mouth of the river
    Nile, third of the three great cities of antiquity
    excepting Carthage during Apicius' time a rival of Rome
    and Athens in splendor and commerce. Most important as a
    Mediterranean port, where fishing and fish eating was
    (and still is) good.

    [2] G.-V. _mulsum_, mead.


[438] ANOTHER ALEXANDRINE SAUCE FOR BROILED FISH
    _ALITER IUS ALEXANDRINUM IN PISCE ASSO_

PEPPER, LOVAGE, GREEN CORIANDER, SEEDLESS RAISINS, WINE, RAISIN WINE,
BROTH, OIL, COOKED TOGETHER.


[439] ANOTHER ALEXANDRINE SAUCE FOR BROILED FISH
    _ALITER IUS ALEXANDRINUM IN PISCE ASSO_

PEPPER, LOVAGE, GREEN CORIANDER, ONIONS, STONED DAMASCUS PRUNES,
RAISIN WINE, BROTH, OIL AND VINEGAR, AND COOK.


[440] SAUCE FOR BROILED CONGER
    _IUS IN CONGRO ASSO_

PEPPER, LOVAGE, CRUSHED CUMIN, ORIGANY, DRY ONIONS, HARD YOLKS, WINE,
MEAD, VINEGAR, BROTH, REDUCED MUST, AND COOK.

    G.-V. _Gongo_.


[441] SAUCE FOR HORNED FISH [1]
    _IUS IN CORNUTAM_ [1]

PEPPER, LOVAGE, ORIGANY, ONIONS, SEEDLESS RAISINS, WINE, HONEY,
VINEGAR, BROTH, OIL; AND COOK IT [2]

    [1] _Cornuta_, _cornutus_--"horned," "having horns"--an
    unidentified sea fish.

    [2] Goll. collects all succeeding formulæ for sauces
    into one.


[442] SAUCE FOR BROILED MULLET
    _IUS IN MULLOS ASSOS_

PEPPER, LOVAGE, RUE, HONEY, NUTS, VINEGAR, WINE, BROTH, A LITTLE OIL;
HEAT AND POUR OVER [1].

    [1] List. is of the opinion that this is fresh mullet,
    while salt mullet was treated in the preceding formulæ.


[443] ANOTHER SAUCE FOR BROILED MULLET
    _ALITER IUS IN MULLOS ASSOS_

RUE, MINT, CORIANDER, FENNEL,--ALL OF THEM GREEN--PEPPER, LOVAGE,
HONEY, BROTH, AND A LITTLE OIL.


[444] SEASONING FOR BABY TUNNY
    _IUS IN PELAMYDE ASSA_

PEPPER, LOVAGE, ORIGANY, GREEN CORIANDER, ONION, SEEDLESS RAISINS [1],
RAISIN WINE, VINEGAR, BROTH, REDUCED MUST, OIL, AND COOK.

    [1] Wanting in Tor.


[445]

THIS SAUCE IS ALSO SUITABLE FOR BOILED [tunny]; IF DESIRED ADD HONEY.


[446] SAUCE FOR PERCH
    _IUS IN PERCAM_ [1]

PEPPER, LOVAGE, CRUSHED CUMIN, ONIONS, STONED DAMASCUS PRUNES, WINE,
MEAD, VINEGAR, OIL, REDUCED MUST; COOK IT.

    [1] _Perca_, perch--sea perch or sea bass.


[447] SEASONING FOR REDSNAPPER
    _CONDIMENTUM IN RUBELLIONEM_ [1]

PEPPER, LOVAGE, CARRAWAY, WILD THYME, CELERY SEED, DRY ONIONS, WINE,
RAISIN WINE, VINEGAR, BROTH AND OIL; BIND WITH ROUX.

    [1] _Rubellio_--a "reddish" fish; perhaps a species of
    the red-mullet or red-snapper. Hum. says the Latins
    called the fish _rubelliones_, _rubellos_ and _rubros_;
    the Greeks _erythrinos_ or _erythricos_, because of
    their reddish color. A fish, according to Athenæus
    similar to the _pager_ or _pagrus_, _phager_ or
    _phagrus_, also called _pagur_, which is not quite
    identified.



II


[448] SAUCE FOR [BROILED] MURENA
    _IUS IN MURENA [ASSA]_ [1]

PEPPER, LOVAGE, SATURY, SAFFRON [2], ONIONS, STONED DAMASCUS PRUNES,
WINE, MEAD, VINEGAR, REDUCED MUST AND OIL; COOK IT [3].

    [1] V. doubting that this is broiled.

    [2] Tor. _Crocomagma_; List. _crocum magnum_, still used
    today in some fish preparations, particularly in the
    Bouillabaisse.

    [3] The laconic style in which all these fish
    preparations are given, is very confusing to the
    uninitiated. We assume that most of these ingredients
    were used to season the water in which to boil fish; or,
    to make a _court-bouillon_, a fish-essence of the bones
    and the trimmings of the fish, in which to poach the
    sliced fish. The liquor thus gained was reduced and in
    the moment of serving was bound with roux or with yolks,
    and the fish was masked with this sauce. The exceptions
    from this rule are, of course, in cases where the fish
    was broiled or fried.


[449] SAUCE FOR BROILED MURENA

    [2] Note the position of lovage in this formula. Usually
    it follows pepper. We have finally accounted for this
    peculiarity. Torinus, throughout the original, treats
    "pepper" and "lovage" as one spice, whereas we have kept
    the two separate. He believed it to be a certain kind of
    pepper--_piper Ligusticum_. _Piper_, as a matter of
    fact, stands for pepper, and _Ligusticum_ is the herb,
    Lovage, an umbelliferous plant, also called
    _Levisticum_. The fact that the two words are here
    separated plainly shows that Torinus has been in the
    dark about this matter almost to the end.

    One wonders why he did not change or correct this error
    in the preceding books. His marginal errata prove that
    his work was being printed as he wrote it, or furnished
    copy therefor--namely in installments. Since the
    printer's type was limited, each sheet was printed in
    the complete edition, and the type was then used over
    again for the next sheet.

    THE EXCERPTS FROM APICIUS
    BY VINIDARIUS
    THE ILLUSTRIOUS MAN

_Apici Excerpta A Vinidario Viro Inlustri_

FIFTH CENTURY


Vinidarius, a Goth, of noble birth or a scientist, living in Italy.
Vinithaharjis is the native name. Of his time and life very little is
known. It appears that he was a student of Apicius and that he made
certain excerpts from that book which are preserved in the uncial
codex of Salmasius, sæc. VIII, Paris, lat. 10318.

Vollmer in his Apicius commentary says that Salmasius and his
predecessors have accepted them as genuine. Schuch incorporated these
recipes in the Apicius text of his editions, in appropriate places, as
he thought. This course cannot be recommended, although the recipes
should form an integral part of any Apicius edition.

M. Ihm, who faithfully reprinted the excerpta in the Archiv f. lat.
Lex. XV, 64, ff. says distinctly: "These excerpts have nothing to do
with the ten books of Apicius, even if some recipes resemble each
other ..." and other researchers have expressed the same opinion.
Vollmer, however, does not share this view.

If I may be permitted to concur with Vollmer, I would say that the
excerpts are quite Apician in character, and that in a sense they fill
certain gaps in the Apicius text, although the language is strongly
vulgarized which may be readily expected to be the case in the age of
Vinidarius.

The recipes of Anthimus, written around A.D. 511 also confirm the
close relation existing between Vinidarius and Apicius. Anthimus was
the Greek physician to Theodoric I, (The Great), Frankish king living
in Italy. He was not acquainted with Apicius.

    [1] _Brevis cyboru_ could be nicely and appropriately
    rendered with "Menu,"--something minute, short,--but
    this list is not a menu in our modern sense. It is an
    enumeration of recipe names, a summary of dishes
    contained in the excerpts.

    There is considerable variation in the spelling of the
    names here and in the following. Syllables ending with
    "u" are invariably abbreviations of "um."



I


[468] A CASSEROLE [1] OF VEGETABLE AND CHICKEN
    _CACCABINAM MINOREM_

ARRANGE DIFFERENT KINDS OF COOKED VEGETABLES IN A CASSEROLE WITH
[cooked] CHICKEN INTERSPERSED, IF YOU LIKE; SEASON WITH BROTH AND OIL,
SET TO BOIL. NEXT CRUSH A LITTLE PEPPER AND LEAVES, AND MIX AN EGG IN
WITH THE DRESSING [add this to the vegetables] PRESS [into the
casserole, eliminating the juice] [2].

    [1] The dish resembles a chartreuse.

    [2] Juice should be extracted before the addition of the
    egg, if the dish is to be unmoulded.



Ia


[469] THE SAME, WITH ANOTHER DRESSING, A CABBAGE _CHARTREUSE_
    _ALIAS: TRITURA UNDE PERFUNDES CACCABINAM_

CRUSH WHATEVER QUANTITY OF LEAVES IS REQUIRED WITH CHERVIL AND ONE AND
A QUARTER PART OF LAUREL BERRIES, A MEDIUM-SIZED BOILED CABBAGE,
CORIANDER LEAVES, DISSOLVE WITH ITS OWN JUICE, STEAM IN THE HOT ASHES,
BUT FIRST PLACE IN A MOULD [when stiff unmould on a platter] DECORATE,
POUR UNDER A WELL-SEASONED SAUCE, AND SO SERVE [1].

    [1] Either the vegetables and chicken of ℞ No. 468
    are combined with this dressing or a purée of the above
    cabbage, etc., is made, which will make this an integral
    dish. The instructions are vague enough to leave room
    for this choice; but there can be no doubt but what we
    have here a formula for a vegetable purée or a pudding,
    a genuine "Chartreuse," such as were prepared in the
    fancy moulds so popular in old Rome. The "Chartreuse,"
    then, is not original with the vegetarian monks of the
    monastery by that name, the Carthusians.



II


[470] A STUFFED CHARTREUSE
    _CACCABINAM _[1]_ FUSILEM_

[Take cooked] MALLOWS, LEEKS, BEETS, OR COOKED CABBAGE SPROUTS [shoots
or tender strunks] THRUSHES [roast] AND QUENELLES OF CHICKEN, TIDBITS
OF PORK OR SQUAB CHICKEN AND OTHER SIMILAR SHREDS OF FINE MEATS THAT
MAY BE AVAILABLE; ARRANGE EVERYTHING ALTERNATELY IN LAYERS [in a mould
or in a casserole]. CRUSH PEPPER AND LOVAGE WITH 2 PARTS OF OLD WINE,
1 PART BROTH, 1 PART HONEY AND A LITTLE OIL. TASTE IT; AND WHEN WELL
MIXED AND IN DUE PROPORTIONS PUT IN A SAUCE PAN AND ALLOW TO HEAT
MODERATELY; WHEN BOILING ADD A PINT OF MILK IN WHICH [about eight]
EGGS HAVE BEEN DISSOLVED; [next] POUR [this spiced custard] OVER [the
layers of vegetables and meats, heat slowly without allowing to boil]
AND WHEN CONGEALED SERVE [either in the casserole, or carefully
unmould the dish on a service platter] [2].

    [1] It is interesting to note how the generic terms,
    _salacaccabia_ and _caccabina_ have degenerated here. In
    these formulas the terms have lost all resemblance to
    the former meaning, the original "salt meat boiled in a
    pot." Such changes are very often observed in the
    terminology of our modern kitchens, in every language.
    They make the definition of terms and the classification
    of subjects extremely difficult. They add much to the
    confusion among cooks and guests in public dining places
    and create misunderstandings that only an expert can
    explain.

    [2] This dish affords an opportunity for a decorative
    scheme by the arrangement of the various vegetables and
    meats in a pleasing and artistic manner, utilizing the
    various colors and shapes of the bits of food as one
    would use pieces of stone in a mosaic. Of course, such a
    design can be appreciated only if the chartreuse is
    served unmoulded, i.e. if the cook succeeds in
    unmoulding it without damaging the structure.



III


[471] BRAISED CUTLETS
    _OFELLAS GARATAS_ [1]

PLACE THE MEAT IN A STEW PAN, ADD ONE POUND [2] OF BROTH, A LIKE
QUANTITY OF OIL, A TRIFLE OF HONEY, AND THUS BRAISE [3].

    [1] Derived from _garum_ or _œnogarum_, the wine
    sauce. These are supposed to be meat balls or cutlets
    prepared with garum, but the _garum_ is not mentioned in
    the formula. This also illustrates the interesting
    etymology of the word. It is not recognized in every-day
    ancient language because it is a typical technical term,
    the much complained-of _lingua culinaria_. We find,
    therefore, that--at least in this instance--_garum_ no
    longer stands for a sauce made from the fish, _garus_,
    but that _garum_ has become a generic term for certain
    kinds of sauces. Danneil renders _garatus_ with
    _lasaratus_, which is clearly out of place.

    [2] In this instance, and in several others, and also
    according to Sueton. Cæs. fluids were weighed. What idea
    could be more practical, useful and more "modern" than
    this? Sheer commercial greed, stubbornness, indolence
    have thus far made futile all efforts towards more
    progressive methods in handling food stuffs,
    particularly in the weighing of them and in selling them
    by their weight. Present market methods are very
    chaotic, and are kept purposely so to the detriment of
    the buyer.

    [3] The original: _et sic frigis_.--_Frigo_ is
    equivalent to frying, drying, parching; the word here
    has taken on a broader meaning, because the "frying"
    process is clearly out of question here. It appears that
    the terminology of _frigo_ and that of _asso_ in the
    next formula, has not been clearly defined. As a matter
    of fact, not many modern cooks today are able to give a
    clear definition of such terms as frying, broiling,
    roasting, braising, baking, which are thus subject to
    various interpretations.



IV


[472] ROAST MEAT BALLS
    _OFELLAS ASSAS_

MEATBALLS [previously sauté], CAREFULLY PREPARED, ARRANGE IN A SHALLOW
STEW PAN AND BRAISE THEM IN WINE SAUCE; AFTERWARDS SERVE THEM IN THE
SAME SAUCE OR GRAVY, SPRINKLED WITH PEPPER.



V


[473] GLAZED CUTLETS
    _ALITER OFELLAS_

THE MEAT PIECES ARE BRAISED [1] IN BROTH AND ARE GLAZED [2] WITH HOT
HONEY [3] AND THUS SERVED.

    [1] Cf. note 3 to Excerpta III.

    [2] _unguantur._

    [3] Dann. oil; G.-V. _melle_--_honey_. It is quite
    common to use honey for glazing foods. Today we sprinkle
    meats (ham) with sugar, exposing it to the open heat to
    melt it; the sugar thus forms a glaze or crust.



VI


[474] MEAT BALLS WITH LASER
    _OFELLAS GARATAS_ [1]

LASER, GINGER, CARDAMOM, AND A DASH OF BROTH; CRUSH THIS ALL, MIX
WELL, AND COOK THE MEAT BALL THEREIN [2].

    [1] Cf. Summary of Dishes, and note 1 to Excerpta III.

    [2] Dann. adds cumin, due perhaps to the faulty reading
    of the sentence, _misces cum his omnibus tritis_, etc.



VII


[475] SEA-SCORPION WITH TURNIPS
    _PISCES SCORPIONES RAPULATOS_ [1]

COOK [the fish] IN BROTH AND OIL, RETIRE WHEN HALF DONE: SOAK BOILED
TURNIPS, CHOP VERY FINE AND SQUEEZE THEM IN YOUR HANDS SO THAT THEY
HAVE NO MORE MOISTURE IN THEM; THEN COMBINE THEM WITH THE FISH AND LET
THEM SIMMER WITH PLENTY OF OIL: AND WHILE THIS COOKS, CRUSH CUMIN,
HALF OF THAT AMOUNT OF LAUREL BERRIES, AND, BECAUSE OF THE COLOR, ADD
SAFFRON; BIND WITH RICE FLOUR TO GIVE IT THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY. ADD A
DASH OF VINEGAR AND SERVE.

    [1] _rapa_, _rapum_: white turnip, rape; "turniped."



VIII


[476] [Sauce for] ANY KIND OF FISH, FRIED MAKE THUS:
    _PISCES FRIXOS CUIUSCUMQUE GENERIS_

CRUSH PEPPER, CORIANDER SEED, LASER ROOT, ORIGANY, RUE, FIGDATES,
MOISTEN WITH VINEGAR, OIL, BROTH, ADDING REDUCED MUST, ALL THIS
PREPARE AND MIX CAREFULLY, PLACE IN SMALL CASSEROLE TO HEAT. WHEN
THOROUGHLY HEATED, POUR OVER THE FRIED FISH, SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND
SERVE.



IX


[477] [Sauce for] SAME FRIED FISH MAKE THUS:
    _ITEM PISCES FRIXOS_

CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE [1], LAUREL BERRIES, CORIANDER, AND MOISTEN WITH
HONEY, BROTH [2], WINE, RAISIN WINE, OR REDUCED SPICED WINE; COOK
THIS ON A SLOW FIRE, BIND WITH RICE FLOUR AND SERVE.

    [1] Sch. _ligisticum_.

    [2] Wanting in Sch.



X


[478] [Sauce for] ROAST FISH [1]
    _PISCES ASSOS_

CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, SATURY, DRY ONIONS, MOISTEN WITH VINEGAR, ADD
FIGDATES, DILL, YOLKS OF EGG, HONEY, VINEGAR, BROTH, OIL, REDUCED
MUST; ALL THIS MIX THOROUGHLY AND UNDERLAY [the fish with it].

    [1] The fish was probably broiled on the _craticula_
    (see our illustration).

    The nature of this sauce is not quite clear. If properly
    handled, it might turn out to be a highly seasoned
    mayonnaise, or a vinaigrette, depending on the mode of
    manipulation; either would be suitable for fried or
    broiled fish.



XI


[479] FISH AND WINE SAUCE
    _PISCES ŒNOTEGANON_ [1]

FRY THE FISH; CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, RUE, GREEN HERBS, DRY ONIONS, ADD
OIL [wine] BROTH AND SERVE.

    [1] Ihm and G.-V. _œnoteganon_; _inotogono_ and in
    the Summary of Dishes _inotogonon_; Sch. _eleogaro_.
    Rather an obscure term, owing to the diversity of
    spelling. We would call it a dish stewed in or prepared
    with wine, although wine is absent in the present
    formula. However, it is given in XIII, which bears the
    same name.

    Dann. is obviously mistaken in styling this preparation
    "oil broth."



XII


[480] [Cold Sauce for] SARDINES MAKE THUS:
    _SARDAS _[1]_ SIC FACIES_

CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE SEED, ORIGANY, DRY ONIONS, HARD BOILED YOLKS,
VINEGAR, OIL; THIS MUST BE COMBINED INTO ONE [2] AND UNDERLAID.

    [1] A kind of small tunny, which, like our herring, used
    to be pickled or salt, corresponding to the anchovy. A
    "sardine," from the island of Sardinia; _Sardus_, the
    inhabitant of Sardinia.

    [2] The absence of detailed instructions as to the
    manipulation of the yolks, oil and vinegar is
    regrettable; upon them depends the certainty or
    uncertainty of whether the ancients had our modern
    mayonnaise.



XIII


[481] FISH STEWED IN WINE
    _PISCES ŒNOTEGANON_ [1]

RAW FISH ANY KIND YOU PREFER, WASH [prepare, cut into handy size]
ARRANGE IN A SAUCE PAN; ADD OIL, BROTH, VINEGAR, A BUNCH OF LEEKS AND
[fresh] CORIANDER, AND COOK: [Meanwhile] CRUSH PEPPER, ORIGANY, LOVAGE
WITH THE BUNCHES OF LEEKS AND CORIANDER WHICH YOU HAVE COOKED [with
the fish] AND POUR [this preparation] INTO THE SAUCE PAN. [When the
fish is done, retire it and arrange the pieces in the serving dish,
casserole, bowl or platter] BRING THE RESIDUE IN THE SAUCE PAN TO A
BOILING POINT, ALLOW IT TO REDUCE SLOWLY TO THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY
[Strain the sauce of the fish] SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.

    [1] Cf. note to XI. This _œnoteganon_ resembles the
    _Bouillabaisse_, the famous Marseilles fish chowder. In
    addition to the above manner it is flavored with
    saffron. An excellent dish, especially with the
    judicious addition of onions, parsley, a suspicion of
    garlic and small sippets of toasted bread.



XIV


[482] MULLET STEWED WITH DILL MAKE THUS:
    _MULLOS ANETHATOS _[1]_ SIC FACIES_

PREPARE THE FISH [clean, wash, trim, cut into pieces] AND PLACE IN A
SAUCE PAN, ADDING OIL, BROTH, WINE, BUNCHES OF LEEKS, [fresh]
CORIANDER, [fresh dill]; PLACE ON FIRE TO COOK. [Meanwhile] PUT PEPPER
IN THE MORTAR, POUND IT, ADD OIL, AND ONE PART OF VINEGAR AND RAISIN
WINE TO TASTE. [This preparation] TRANSFER INTO A SAUCE PAN, PLACE ON
THE FIRE TO HEAT, TIE WITH ROUX, ADD TO THE FISH IN THE SAUCE PAN.
SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.

    [1] From _anethus_--dill--which is omitted in formula.
    Sch. _anecatos_, i.e. _submersos_, because the original
    fails to state the dill in the formula. Such conjecture
    is not justified.



XV


[483] MULLET ANOTHER STYLE
    _ALITER MULLOS_

SCRAPE, WASH, PLACE [the fish] IN A SAUCE PAN, ADD OIL, BROTH, WINE
AND A BUNCH OF LEEKS AND [fresh] CORIANDER TO THE MESS, SET ON THE
FIRE TO COOK. CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, ORIGANY, MOISTEN WITH SOME OF THE
FISH'S OWN LIQUOR [from the sauce pan] ADD RAISIN WINE TO TASTE, PUT
IT INTO A POT AND ON THE FIRE TO HEAT; TIE WITH ROUX AND PRESENTLY ADD
IT TO THE CONTENTS IN THE SAUCE PAN [1] SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND
SERVE.

    [1] It appears that the _patina_ mentioned in this and
    in the foregoing formula is either a finely wrought
    metal sauce pan or chafing dish, or a plainer _cumana_,
    an earthenware casserole; either of which may be used
    for service at the table.

    It may be noticed how this manner of preparing fish has
    a tendency to preserve all the savory flavors and juices
    of the fish, a process in this respect both rational and
    economical.



XVI


[484] MURENA [1], EEL [2] OR MULLET MAKE THUS:
    _MURENAM AUT ANGUILLAS VEL MULLOS SIC FACIES_

CLEAN THE FISH AND CAREFULLY PLACE IN A SAUCE PAN. IN THE MORTAR PUT
PEPPER, LOVAGE, ORIGANY, MINT, DRY ONIONS, CRUSH, MOISTEN WITH A SMALL
GLASS OF WINE, HALF OF THAT OF BROTH, AND OF HONEY ONE THIRD PART, AND
A MODERATE AMOUNT OF REDUCED MUST, SAY A SPOONFUL. IT IS NECESSARY
THAT THE FISH BE ENTIRELY COVERED BY THIS LIQUOR SO THAT THERE MAY BE
SUFFICIENT JUICE DURING THE COOKING.

    [1] The ancients considered the murena one of the finest
    of fish; the best were brought from the straits of
    Sicily. Rich Romans kept them alive in their fish ponds,
    often large and elaborate marble basins called,
    _piscina_, fattened the fish, kept it ready for use.
    Pollio fattened murenas on human flesh, killing a slave
    on the slightest provocation and throwing the body into
    the fish pond; he would eat only the liver of such
    murenas. This is the only case of such cruelty on
    record, and it has often been cited and exaggerated.

    [2] Perhaps the sea-eel, or conger, according to Dann.
    Also very much esteemed. The witty Plautus names a cook
    in one of his comedies "Congrio," because the fellow was
    "slippery."



XVII


[485] [Dressing for] SPINY LOBSTER (AND SQUILL)
    _LOCUSTAM (ET SCILLAM)_ [1]

CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, CELERY SEED, POUR IN VINEGAR, BROTH, YOLKS OF
[hard boiled] EGGS, MIX WELL TOGETHER [2] AND DRESS [the boiled
shellfish meat with it] AND SERVE.

    [1] Cf. Summary of Dishes.

    [2] Another of Apicii hasty and laconic formulæ. No
    indication as to how to use the ingredients named.
    According to our notion of eating, there is only one
    way: The shellfish is boiled in aromatic water, allowed
    to cool off; the meat is then taken out of the shells;
    the above named ingredients are combined in a manner of
    a mayonnaise or a vinaigrette, although the necessary
    oil is not mentioned here. The dressing is poured over
    the shellfish meat, and the result is a sort of salad or
    "cocktail" as we have today.



XVIII


[486] [Sauce] FOR BOILED FISH
    _IN PISCIBUS ELIXIS_

CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, CELERY SEED, ORIGANY WHICH MOISTEN WITH VINEGAR;
ADD PINE NUTS, FIGDATES [1] IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITY, HONEY, VINEGAR,
BROTH, MUSTARD, MIX AND COMBINE PROPERLY AND BRING FORTH.

    [1] Dann. is undecided as to whether this is dates or
    date wine; Goll. thinks it is mustard seed, which is not
    so bad gastronomically; but the original leaves no room
    for any doubt.



XIX


[487] A DISH OF SOLE WITH EGGS
    _PATINA SOLEARUM EX OVIS_

SCALE [skin] CLEAN [the soles], PLACE IN A [shallow] SAUCE PAN, ADD
BROTH, OIL [white] WINE, A BUNCH OF LEEKS AND CORIANDER SEED, PLACE ON
FIRE TO COOK, GRIND A LITTLE PEPPER, ORIGANY, MOISTEN WITH THE FISH
LIQUOR [from the sauce pan]. TAKE 10 RAW EGGS, BEAT THEM AND MIX WITH
THE REMAINING LIQUOR; PUT IT ALL BACK OVER THE FISH, AND ON A SLOW
FIRE ALLOW TO HEAT [without boiling] AND THICKEN TO THE RIGHT
CONSISTENCY; SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER [1].

    [1] Very similar to _Sole au vin blanc_. Cf. ℞ No.
    155.



XX


[488] SUCKLING PIG, CORIANDER SAUCE
    _PORCELLUM CORIANDRATUM_

ROAST THE PIG CAREFULLY; MAKE THUS A MORTAR MIXTURE: POUND PEPPER,
DILL, ORIGANY, GREEN CORIANDER, MOISTEN WITH HONEY, WINE, BROTH, OIL,
VINEGAR, REDUCED MUST. ALL OF THIS WHEN HOT POUR OVER [the roast]
SPRINKLE RAISINS, PINE NUTS AND CHOPPED ONIONS OVER AND SO SERVE.



XXI


[489] SUCKLING PIG, WINE SAUCE
    _PORCELLUM ÆNOCOCTUM_ [1]

TAKE THE PIG, GARNISH [with a marinade of herbs, etc.] COOK [roast] IT
WITH OIL AND BROTH. WHEN DONE, PUT IN THE MORTAR PEPPER, RUE, LAUREL
BERRIES, BROTH, RAISIN WINE OR REDUCED WINE, OLD WINE, CRUSH ALL, MIX
AND PREPARE TO A POINT; DRESS THE PIG ON A SHOWY SERVICE [2] PLATTER
AND SERVE.

    [1] i.e. _œnococtum_, cooked or prepared in wine
    sauce.

    [2] Dann. is of the opinion that the pig is cooked in a
    copper vessel, because the instructions are to serve it
    _in patinam aheneam_.



XXII


[490] PIG, PAN GRAVY
    _PORCELLUM EO IURE_

ROAST THE PIG IN ITS OWN JUICE; [when done] RETIRE; BIND THE GRAVY
WITH ROUX; [strain] PUT IN A SAUCE BOAT AND SERVE.



XXIII


[491] PIG SPRINKLED WITH THYME
    _PORCELLUM THYMO SPARSUM_

MILK-FED PIG, KILLED ON THE PREVIOUS DAY, BOIL WITH SALT AND DILL;
TRANSFER IT INTO COLD WATER, CAREFULLY KEEPING IT SUBMERGED, TO
PRESERVE ITS WHITENESS. THEREUPON [make a cold dressing of the
following] GREEN SAVORY HERBS, [fresh] THYME, A LITTLE FLEABANE, HARD
BOILED EGGS, ONIONS, [everything] CHOPPED FINE, SPRINKLE EVERYTHING
[over the pig which has been taken out of the water and allowed to
drip off] AND SEASON WITH A PINT OF BROTH, ONE MEASURE OF OIL, ONE OF
RAISIN WINE, AND SO PRESENT IT [1].

    [1] We would first mix the liquid components of this
    dressing with the chopped ingredients and then spread
    the finished dressing over the pig. Our author, no
    doubt, had this very process in mind.



XXIV


[492] PICKLED SUCKLING PIG
    _PORCELLUM OXYZOMUM_ [1]

GARNISH [prepare and marinate] THE PIG CORRECTLY AND PLACE IT IN A
LIQUOR PREPARED AS FOLLOWS: PUT IN THE MORTAR 50 GRAINS OF PEPPER, AS
MUCH HONEY [2] AS IS REQUIRED, 3 DRY ONIONS, A LITTLE GREEN OR DRY
CORIANDER, A PINT OF BROTH, 1 SEXTARIUS OF OIL, 1 PINT OF WATER; [all
this] PUT IN A STEW PAN [braisière] PLACE THE PIG IN IT; WHEN IT
COMMENCES TO BOIL, STIR THE GRAVY QUITE FREQUENTLY [3] SO AS TO
THICKEN IT. SHOULD THE BROTH THUS BE REDUCED [by evaporation] ADD
ANOTHER PINT OF WATER. IN THIS MANNER COOK [braise] THE PIG TO
PERFECTION AND SERVE IT.

    [1] _exodionum_, and in the Summary of Dishes,
    _exozome_, i.e. _oxyzomum_. It is curious to note the
    various spellings and meanings of _oxyzomum_. This is
    supposed to be a sour sauce or an acid preparation of
    some kind, yet this recipe does not mention acids. In
    fact, the presence of honey would make it a sweet
    preparation. We take it, the "garnish" contains the
    necessary vinegar or other acids such as lemon juice,
    wine, etc. _Oxyzomum_ is properly rendered "pickle."

    [2] Dann. oil, occurring twice in his version.

    [3] _sæpius_; Dann. confusing _sæpe_ with _cæpa_,
    renders this "onions sauce." The same occurs to him in
    XXVII.



XXV


[493] PIG WITH LASER
    _PORCELLUM LASARATUM_

IN THE MORTAR POUND PEPPER, LOVAGE, CARRAWAY, A LITTLE CUMIN, LIVE
LASER, LASER ROOT, MOISTEN WITH VINEGAR, ADD PINE NUTS, FIGDATES,
HONEY, VINEGAR, BROTH, PREPARED MUSTARD, FINISH WITH OIL TO TASTE, AND
POUR OVER [the roast pig].



XXVI


[494] PIG IN SAUCE
    _PORCELLUM IUSCELLATUM_

IN THE MORTAR PUT PEPPER, LOVAGE, OR ANISE, CORIANDER, RUE, A LAUREL
BERRY, POUND [all], MOISTENING WITH BROTH, [add] LEEKS, RAISIN WINE,
OR A LITTLE HONEY, A LITTLE WINE, AND A LIKE AMOUNT OF OIL. WHEN THIS
HAS BEEN COOKED TIE WITH ROUX.



XXVII


[495] PLAIN LAMB [1]
    _AGNUM SIMPLICEM_

OF THE SKINNED LAMB MAKE SMALL CUTLETS WHICH WASH CAREFULLY AND
ARRANGE IN A SAUCE PAN, ADD OIL, BROTH, WINE, LEEKS, CORIANDER CUT
WITH THE KNIFE; WHEN IT COMMENCES TO BOIL, STIR VERY FREQUENTLY [2]
AND SERVE.

    [1] Unquestionably the ancient equivalent for "Irish
    Stew."

    [2] Cf. note 3 to ℞ 492, XXIV; the presence of onion,
    however, would do no harm here.



XXVIII


[496] KID WITH LASER
    _HÆDUM LASARATUM_

THE WELL-CLEANED GUTS OF A KID FILL WITH [a preparation of] PEPPER,
BROTH, LASER, OIL [1], AND PUT THEM BACK INTO THE CARCASS WHICH SEW
TIGHTLY AND THUS COOK [roast] THE KID [whole]. WHEN DONE PUT IN THE
MORTAR RUE, LAUREL BERRIES, AND THEN SERVE THE KID WHICH MEANWHILE HAS
BEEN RETIRED FROM THE POT WITH ITS OWN DRIPPINGS OR GRAVY.

    [1] There being only liquids for this filling of the
    guts, a more solid substance, such as pork forcemeat,
    eggs, or cereals would be required to make an acceptable
    filling for the casings of the kid. Furthermore sausage,
    for such is this in fact, must be thoroughly cooked
    before it can be used for the filling of the carcass, as
    not sufficient heat would penetrate the interior during
    the roasting to cook any raw dressing.



XXIX


[497] THRUSH "À LA SANTÉ"
    _TURDOS HAPANTAMYNOS_ [1]

CRUSH PEPPER, LASER, LAUREL BERRY, MIX IN CUMIN [2] GARUM AND STUFF
THE THRUSH [with this preparation, [3]] THROUGH THE THROAT [4], TYING
THEM WITH A STRING. THEREUPON MAKE THIS PREPARATION IN WHICH THEY ARE
COOKED: CONSISTING OF OIL, SALT, WATER [5], DILL AND HEADS OF LEEKS.

    [1] Cf. Summary of Dishes; term not identified, derived
    from the Greek, meaning to drive away all stomach ills.

    [2] We use juniper berries today instead of cumin.

    [3] Cf. note to ℞ 496, XXVIII.

    [4] Thrush and other game birds of such small size are
    not emptied in the usual way: they are cooked with the
    entrails, or, the intestines are taken out, seasoned,
    sauté, and are either put back into the carcasses, or
    are served separately on bread croutons. In this
    instance, the necessary seasoning is introduced through
    the throat, a most ingenious idea that can only occur to
    Apicius.

    [5] In other instances we have pointed out where a small
    amount of water was used to clarify the oil used for
    frying foods. The presence here of water leads us to
    believe that the thrush were not "cooked," i.e. "boiled"
    but that they were fried in a generous amount of oil;
    this would make the ancient process remarkably similar
    to the present European way of preparing thrush or
    fieldfare, or similar game birds.

    For water used to clarify oil see note 3 to ℞ No.
    250.



XXX


[498] TURTLEDOVES
    _TURTURES_

OPEN THEM, PREPARE [marinate] CAREFULLY; CRUSH PEPPER, LASER, A LITTLE
BROTH, IMMERSE THE DOVES IN THIS PREPARATION SO THAT IT WILL BE
ABSORBED BY THEM, AND THUS ROAST THEM.



XXXI


[499] SAUCE FOR PARTRIDGE [1]
    _IUS IN PERDICES_

CRUSH IN THE MORTAR PEPPER, CELERY, MINT, AND RUE; MOISTEN WITH
VINEGAR, ADD FIGDATE [wine], HONEY, VINEGAR, BROTH, OIL; LET IT BOIL
LIKEWISE AND SERVE.

    [1] This formula evidently is a fragment.
