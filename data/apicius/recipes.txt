  2925	[1] FINE SPICED WINE
  2926	  _CONDITUM PARADOXUM_
  2927	
  2928	THE COMPOSITION OF [this] EXCELLENT SPICED WINE [is as follows]. INTO
  2929	A COPPER BOWL PUT 6 SEXTARII [1] OF HONEY AND 2 SEXTARII OF WINE; HEAT
  2930	ON A SLOW FIRE, CONSTANTLY STIRRING THE MIXTURE WITH A WHIP. AT THE
  2931	BOILING POINT ADD A DASH OF COLD WINE, RETIRE FROM STOVE AND SKIM.
  2932	REPEAT THIS TWICE OR THREE TIMES, LET IT REST TILL THE NEXT DAY, AND
  2933	SKIM AGAIN. THEN ADD 4 OZS. OF CRUSHED PEPPER [2], 3 SCRUPLES OF
  2934	MASTICH, A DRACHM EACH OF [nard or laurel] LEAVES AND SAFFRON, 5
  2935	DRACHMS OF ROASTED DATE STONES CRUSHED AND PREVIOUSLY SOAKED IN WINE
  2936	TO SOFTEN THEM. WHEN THIS IS PROPERLY DONE ADD 18 SEXTARII OF LIGHT
  2937	WINE. TO CLARIFY IT PERFECTLY, ADD [crushed] CHARCOAL [3] TWICE OR AS
  2938	OFTEN AS NECESSARY WHICH WILL DRAW [the residue] TOGETHER [and
  2939	carefully strain or filter through the charcoal].
  2940	
  2941	    [1] _Sextarii._ Tor. _partes XV_; G.-V. _pondo XV_;
  2942	    List. _partes XV ... pondo lib.... qui continent
  2943	    sextarios sex_. One sextarius (a "sixth") equals about
  2944	    1-1/2 pint English.
  2945	
  2946	    [2] Pepper. _Piperis uncias IV_--ordinarily our black or
  2947	    white pepper grains, but in connection with honey,
  2948	    sweets, and so forth, the term "pepper" may just as well
  2949	    stand for our allspice, or even for any spicing in
  2950	    general.
  2951	
  2952	    [3] Charcoal. Still a favorite filterer for liquors.
  2953	
  2954	    List. Apicius is correct in starting his book with this
  2955	    formula, as all meals were started with this sort of
  2956	    mixed drink.
  2957	
  2958	    Tor. deviates from the other texts in that he elaborates
  2959	    on the cooking process.

  2962	[2] HONEY REFRESHER FOR TRAVELERS
  2963	  _CONDITUM MELIZOMUM _[1]_ VIATORIUM_
  2964	
  2965	THE WAYFARER'S HONEY REFRESHER (SO CALLED BECAUSE IT GIVES ENDURANCE
  2966	AND STRENGTH TO PEDESTRIANS) [2] WITH WHICH TRAVELERS ARE REFRESHED BY
  2967	THE WAYSIDE IS MADE IN THIS MANNER: FLAVOR HONEY WITH GROUND PEPPER
  2968	AND SKIM. IN THE MOMENT OF SERVING PUT HONEY IN A CUP, AS MUCH AS IS
  2969	DESIRED TO OBTAIN THE RIGHT DEGREE OF SWEETNESS, AND MIX SPICED WINE
  2970	NOT MORE THAN A NEEDED QUANTITY; ALSO ADD SOME WINE TO THE SPICED
  2971	HONEY TO FACILITATE ITS FLOW AND THE MIXING.
  2972	
  2973	    [1] Tor. _Melirhomum_; _non extat_. G.-V. M.
  2974	    _perpetuum_, i.e., having good keeping qualities.
  2975	
  2976	    [2] Tor. reads thus whereas others apply "endurance" to
  2977	    the honey itself. The honey could not be preserved
  2978	    (_perpetuum_) by the addition of pepper. Any addition,
  2979	    as a matter of fact, would hasten its deterioration
  2980	    unless the honey were boiled and sealed tight, which the
  2981	    original takes for granted.

  3024	REMOVED, SEWED INTO A LINEN BAG AND IMMERSED IN WINE FOR SEVEN DAYS.
  3025	THEREUPON ADD A SACK OF NEW PETALS WHICH ALLOW TO DRAW FOR ANOTHER
  3026	SEVEN DAYS. AGAIN REMOVE THE OLD PETALS AND REPLACE THEM BY FRESH ONES
  3027	FOR ANOTHER WEEK; THEN STRAIN THE WINE THROUGH THE COLANDER. BEFORE
  3028	SERVING, ADD HONEY SWEETENING TO TASTE. TAKE CARE THAT ONLY THE BEST
  3029	PETALS FREE FROM DEW BE USED FOR SOAKING.
  3030	
  3031	    [1] Used principally as a laxative medicine. List. These

  3047	FULL OF FRESH CITRUS LEAVES IS IMMERSED IN THE VAT OF NEW WINE BEFORE
  3048	FERMENTATION HAS SET IN. AFTER FORTY DAYS RETIRE THE LEAVES, AND, AS
  3049	OCCASION ARISES, SWEETEN THE WINE WITH HONEY, AND PASS IT UP FOR ROSE

  3064	CYPRIAN RUSH AND GREEN LAUREL LEAVES THAT ARE NOT TOO OLD, ALL OF IT
  3065	CRUSHED AND MACERATED AND REDUCED TO A FINE POWDER. SIFT THIS IN AND
  3066	ADD FINELY GROUND SALT AND STIR INDUSTRIOUSLY FOR THREE DAYS OR MORE.
  3067	THEN ALLOW TO SETTLE. EVERYBODY WILL TAKE THIS FOR LIBURNIAN OIL. [1]

  3081	THE NEXT DAY THE WINE WILL BE CLEAR [1]. ASHES OF VINES HAVE THE SAME
  3082	EFFECT.
  3083	
  3084	    [1] Ex Lister whose version we prefer. He says, _Alias
  3085	    die erit candidum_ while Tor. adds white salt, saying,
  3086	    _sal si adieceris candidum_, same as Tac. This is
  3087	    unusual, although the ancients have at times treated
  3088	    wine with sea water.

  3097	
  3098	IF BROTH HAS CONTRACTED A BAD ODOR, PLACE A VESSEL UPSIDE DOWN AND
  3099	FUMIGATE IT WITH LAUREL AND CYPRESS AND BEFORE VENTILATING [3] IT,
  3100	POUR THE BROTH IN THIS VESSEL. IF THIS DOES NOT HELP MATTERS [4] AND
  3101	IF THE TASTE IS TOO PRONOUNCED, ADD HONEY AND FRESH SPIKENARD [5] TO
  3102	IT; THAT WILL IMPROVE IT. ALSO NEW MUST SHOULD BE LIKEWISE EFFECTIVE
  3103	[6].
  3104	
  3105	    [1] List. _Liquamen, id est, garum_. Goll. Fish sauce.
  3106	
  3107	    [2] Tor. _Qui liquamen corruptum corrigatur_.
  3108	
  3109	    [3] Dann. Ventilate it. Goll. Whip the sauce in fresh
  3110	    air.
  3111	
  3112	    [4] List., G.-V. _si salsum fuerit_--if this makes it
  3113	    too salty--Tor. _si hoc nihil effecerit_.
  3114	
  3115	    [5] Tor. _novem spicam immittas_; List. _Move spica_;
  3116	    Goll.-Dann. stir with a whip.
  3117	
  3118	    [6] A classic example of Apician confusion when one
  3119	    interpreter reads "s" for "f" and "_novem_" for "_move_"
  3120	    and another reads something else. Tor. is more correct
  3121	    than the others, but this formula is beyond redemption.
  3122	    Fate has decreed that ill-smelling broths shall be
  3123	    discarded.

  3130	[10] TO KEEP MEATS FRESH WITHOUT SALT FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME
  3131	   _UT CARNES SINE SALE QUOVIS TEMPORE RECENTES SINT_
  3132	
  3133	COVER FRESH MEAT WITH HONEY, SUSPEND IT IN A VESSEL. USE AS NEEDED; IN

  3147	    Dispensing with the honey, we use more spices, whole
  3148	    pepper, cloves, bay leaves, also onions and root
  3149	    vegetables. Sometimes a little sugar and wine is added
  3150	    to this preparation which the French call _marinade_ and

  3191	    it would do no good.
  3192	
  3193	    [2] Goll. Take oysters out of the shell, place in
  3194	    vinegar barrel, sprinkle with laurel berries, fine salt,
  3195	    close tight. V. Goll's authority for this version is
  3196	    not found in our originals.
  3197	
  3198	    V. There is no way to keep live oysters fresh except in
  3199	    their natural habitat--salt water. Today we pack them in
  3200	    barrels, feed them with oatmeal, put weights on them--of
  3201	    no avail. The only way English oysters could have
  3202	    arrived fresh in Imperial Rome was in specially
  3203	    constructed bottoms of the galleys.

  3218	NUMBER OF FRESH ONES [3]
  3219	
  3220	    [1] List. and G.-V. _uncia_--ounce. Making an ounce of
  3221	    laser go a long way. Tor. _nucea_; Tac. _nucia_. Lister,
  3222	    fond of hair-splitting, is irreconcilably opposed to
  3223	    Tor., and berates Caspar Barthius for defending Tor.
  3224	    List. _Quam futilis sit in multis labor C. Barthii ut
  3225	    menda Torini passim sustineat, vel ex hoc loco

  3227	    Humelbergio, & ista omnia glossemata vana sunt._
  3228	
  3229	    V. both readings, _uncia_ or _nucia_ are permissible,
  3230	    and make very little difference. We side with Tor. and
  3231	    Tac. because it takes more than an ounce of laser to
  3232	    carry out this experiment.
  3233	
  3234	    [2] _Laser_, _laserpitium_, cf. dictionary.
  3235	
  3236	    [3] V. This article illustrates how sparingly the
  3237	    ancients used the strong and pungent laser flavor [by
  3238	    some believed to be _asa foetida_] because it was very
  3239	    expensive, but principally because the Roman cooks
  3240	    worked economically and knew how to treat spices and
  3241	    flavors judiciously. This article alone should disperse
  3242	    for all time all stories of ancient Rome's extravagance
  3243	    in flavoring and seasoning dishes. It reminds of the
  3244	    methods used by European cooks to get the utmost use out
  3245	    of the expensive vanilla bean: they bury the bean in a
  3246	    can of powdered sugar. They will use the sugar only
  3247	    which has soon acquired a delicate vanilla perfume, and
  3248	    will replace the used sugar by a fresh supply. This is
  3249	    by far a superior method to using the often rank and
  3250	    adulterated "vanilla extract" readily bottled. It is
  3251	    more gastronomical and more economical. Most commercial
  3252	    extracts are synthetic, some injurious. To believe that
  3253	    any of them impart to the dishes the true flavor desired
  3254	    is of course ridiculous. The enormous consumption of
  3255	    such extracts however, is characteristic of our
  3256	    industrialized barbarism which is so utterly indifferent
  3257	    to the fine points in food. Today it is indeed hard for
  3258	    the public to obtain a real vanilla bean.

  3380	MUST BE WATCHED ALL THE TIME [so that they do not spoil].
  3381	
  3382	    V. This and the foregoing formulæ illustrate the
  3383	    ancients' attempts at preserving foods, and they betray
  3384	    their ignorance of "processing" by heating them in
  3385	    hermetically sealed vessels, the principle of which was
  3386	    not discovered until 1810 by Appert which started the
  3387	    now gigantic industry of canning.

  3401	
  3402	ANOTHER WAY: PREPARE MUSTARD HONEY AND VINEGAR ALSO SALT AND COVER
  3403	THEM WITH THE SAME.
  3404	
  3405	    [1] The kind of vegetable to be treated here has not
  3406	    been sufficiently identified. List. and G.-V.
  3407	    _rapæ_--turnips--from _rapus_, seldom _rapa_,--a rape,
  3408	    turnip, navew. Tac. and Tor. _Lapæ_ (_lapathum_), kind
  3409	    of sorrel, monk's rhubarb, dock. Tor. explaining at
  3410	    length: _conditura Rumicis quod lapathon Græci, Latini
  3411	    Lapam quoque dicunt_.
  3412	
  3413	    V. Tor. is correct, or nearly so. Turnips, in the first
  3414	    place, are not in need of any special method of
  3415	    preservation. They keep very well in a cool,
  3416	    well-ventilated place; in fact they would hardly keep
  3417	    very long if treated in the above manner. These
  3418	    directions are better applied to vegetables like dock or
  3419	    monk's rhubarb. Lister, taking Humelbergii word for it,
  3420	    accepts "turnips" as the only truth; but he has little
  3421	    occasion to assail Torinus as he does: _Torinus lapam
  3422	    legit, & nullibi temeritatem suam atque inscientiam
  3423	    magis ostendit._
  3424	
  3425	    Now, if Torinus, according to Lister, "nowhere displays
  3426	    more nerve and ignorance" we can well afford to trust
  3427	    Torinus in cases such as this.
  3428	
  3429	
  3430	[27] TO KEEP TRUFFLES
  3431	   _TUBERA UT DIU SERVENTUR_
  3432	
  3433	THE TRUFFLES WHICH MUST NOT BE TOUCHED BY WATER ARE PLACED ALTERNATELY
  3434	IN DRY SAWDUST; SEAL THE VESSEL WITH PLASTER AND DEPOSIT IT IN A COOL
  3435	PLACE.
  3436	
  3437	    Dann. Clean [peel] the truffles ... in another vessel
  3438	    place the peelings, seal the vessels.... V. this would
  3439	    be the ruin of the truffles, unless they were
  3440	    "processed" in the modern way. Our originals have
  3441	    nothing that would warrant this interpretation.

  3460	AGAINST ALL ILLNESS, AGAINST PESTILENCE AS WELL AS FOR THE PREVENTION
  3461	OF COLDS. THEY ARE VERY GENTLE INDEED AND MORE HEALTHFUL THAN YOU
  3462	WOULD EXPECT. [Tor. MAKE THEM IN THIS MANNER]: 1 LB. OF COMMON SALT

  3472	    [1] In view of the white pepper as directed above, this

  3475	
  3476	    This is one of the few medical formulæ found in Apicius.
  3477	
  3478	    Edward Brandt, _op. cit._, Apiciana No. 29, points out
  3479	    the similarity of this formula with that of the
  3480	    physician, Marcellus, who lived at Rome under Nero,

  3499	
  3500	    Hum. _in illud, legendum puto, in muriam_.
  3501

  3526	
  3527	[Tor.] LASER IS PREPARED IN THIS MANNER: LASER (WHICH IS ALSO CALLED
  3528	LASERPITIUM BY THE ROMANS, WHILE THE GREEKS CALL IT SILPHION) FROM
  3529	CYRENE [1] OR FROM PARTHIA [2] IS DISSOLVED IN LUKEWARM MODERATELY
  3530	ACID BROTH; OR PEPPER, PARSLEY, DRY MINT, LASER ROOT, HONEY, VINEGAR

  3534	    flavored laser.
  3535	
  3536	    [2] Parthia, Asiatic country, still supplying _asa
  3537	    fœtida_.
  3538

  3540	    the demand for it. Cf. Laser in Index.

  3573	    V. Directions wanting whether the above ingredients are
  3574	    to be added to the already prepared _garum_, which see
  3575	    in dictionary. Gollmer gives the following direction for
  3576	    _garum_: Boil a _sextarium_ of anchovies and 3
  3577	    _sextarii_ of good wine until it is thick _purée_.
  3578	    Strain this through a hair sieve and keep it in glass
  3579	    flask for future use. This formula, according to Goll.
  3580	    should have followed our No. 9; but we find no authority
  3581	    for it in the original.
  3582	
  3583	    _Oenogarum_ proper would be a _garum_ prepared with
  3584	    wine, but in this instance it is the broth in which the
  3585	    truffles were cooked that is to be flavored with the
  3586	    above ingredients. There is no need and no mention of
  3587	    _garum_ proper. Thus prepared it might turn out to be a
  3588	    sensible sauce for truffles in the hands of a good
  3589	    practitioner.
  3590	
  3591	    Note the etymology of the word "garum," now serving as a
  3592	    generic name for "sauce" which originally stood for a
  3593	    compound of the fish _garus_.

  3773	    [1] Tor. _Artoptes_; Tac. _Artoptus_. This may have been
  3774	    derived from _artopta_--a vessel in which bread and
  3775	    pudding are baked. However, Sarcoptes is the better
  3776	    word, which is Greek, meaning "chopped meats."

  3786	[41] MINCED DISHES
  3787	   _ISICIA_
  3788	
  3789	THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF MINCED DISHES [1] SEAFOOD MINCES [2] ARE MADE
  3790	OF SEA-ONION, OR SEA CRAB-FISH, LOBSTER, CUTTLE-FISH, INK FISH, SPINY
  3791	LOBSTER, SCALLOPS AND OYSTERS [3]. THE FORCEMEAT IS SEASONED WITH
  3792	LOVAGE [4], PEPPER, CUMIN AND LASER ROOT.
  3793	
  3794	    [1] Tor. Sentence wanting in other texts. V. Forcemeats,
  3795	    minced meats, sausage. Tor. _Hysitia_, from _Isicia_.
  3796	    This term is derived from _insicium_, from _salsicium_,
  3797	    from _salsum insicium_, cut salt meat; old French
  3798	    _salcisse_, _saulcisse_, modern French _saucisse_,
  3799	    meaning sausage. This is a confirmation of the meaning
  3800	    of the word _salsum_--meaning primarily salt meat, bacon
  3801	    in particular. It has survived in modern French
  3802	    terminology in _salés_ more specially _petits
  3803	    salés_--small rashers of bacon. _Salsum_ has caused much
  3804	    confusion in some later formulæ. Cf. notes to Nos. 148,
  3805	    150, 152.
  3806	
  3807	    [2] V. fish forcemeats, fish balls, fish cakes and
  3808	    similar preparations.

  3814	
  3815	[42] CUTTLE-FISH CROQUETTES
  3816	   _ISICIA DE LOLLIGINE_ [1]
  3817	
  3818	THE MEAT IS SEPARATED FROM BONES, SKIN [and refuse] CHOPPED FINE AND
  3819	POUNDED IN THE MORTAR. SHAPE THE FORCEMEAT INTO NEAT CROQUETTES [2]
  3820	AND COOK THEM IN LIQUAMEN [3].
  3821	
  3822	THEY ARE DISPLAYED NICELY ON A LARGE DISH.
  3823	
  3824	    V. This formula plainly calls for fish balls braised or
  3825	    stewed in broth. Ordinarily we would boil the fish first
  3826	    and then separate the meat from the bones, shred or chop
  3827	    it fine, bind with cream sauce, flour and eggs; some add
  3828	    potatoes as a binder, and fry.
  3829	
  3830	    [1] G.-V. _lolligine_; Tor. _loligine_, which is
  3831	    correctly spelled.
  3832	
  3833	    [2] Tac. and Tor. _in pulmento tundes_. G.-V. _fulmento_
  3834	    which is wrong. _Pulmentum_, abbreviated for
  3835	    _pulpamentum_, from _pulpa_. It means a fleshy piece of
  3836	    fish or meat, a tid-bit.
  3837	
  3838	    [3] The original says _in liquamine fricatur_--fry in
  3839	    l., which is impossible in the sense of the word,
  3840	    frying. Either "frying" here stands for cooking,
  3841	    stewing, braising, poaching, or else the so mysterious
  3842	    _liquamen_ must here mean deep fat. Most likely these
  3843	    fish forcemeat balls were fried in olive oil. Cf. ℞
  3844	    No. 46.
  3845	
  3846	
  3847	[43] LOBSTER OR CRABMEAT CROQUETTES
  3848	   _ISICIA DE SCILLIS VEL DE CAMMARIS AMPLIS_ [1]
  3849	
  3850	THE SHELLS OF THE LOBSTERS OR CRABS [which are cooked] ARE BROKEN, THE
  3851	MEAT EXTRACTED FROM THE HEAD AND POUNDED IN THE MORTAR WITH PEPPER AND
  3852	THE BEST KIND OF BROTH. THIS PULP [is shaped into neat little cakes
  3853	which are fried] AND SERVED UP NICELY [2].
  3854	
  3855	    [1] _Scilla_ or _squilla_, squill, sea-onion, also a
  3856	    crab, _cammarus amplus_, large lobster, langouste, spiny
  3857	    lobster.
  3858	
  3859	    [2] The original omits the mode of cooking the fish. A
  3860	    case where it is taken for granted that the shellfish is
  3861	    boiled in water alive. The broth (_liquamen_) is a thick
  3862	    fish sauce in this case, serving as a binder for the
  3863	    meat, conforming to present methods.
  3864	
  3865	    Dann. Fill this into sausage casing. There is no
  3866	    authority for this.
  3867	
  3868	
  3869	[44] LIVER KROMESKIS
  3870	   _OMENTATA_ [1]
  3871	
  3872	OMENTATA ARE MADE IN THIS MANNER: [lightly] FRY PORK LIVER, REMOVE
  3873	SKIN AND SINEWS FIRST [2]. CRUSH PEPPER AND RUE IN A MORTAR WITH [a
  3874	little] BROTH, THEN ADD THE LIVER, POUND AND MIX. THIS PULP SHAPE INTO
  3875	SMALL SAUSAGE, WRAP EACH IN CAUL AND LAUREL LEAVES AND HANG THEM UP TO
  3876	BE SMOKED. WHENEVER YOU WANT AND WHEN READY TO ENJOY THEM TAKE THEM
  3877	OUT OF THE SMOKE, FRY THEM AGAIN, AND ADD GRAVY [3].
  3878	
  3879	    [1] From _omentum_--caul, the membrane enclosing the
  3880	    bowels. Hence "omen." Minced meats wrapped in caul and
  3881	    fried are kromeskis in kitchen terminology.
  3882	
  3883	    [2] First--an after thought so characteristic in
  3884	    culinary literature, proof enough that this formula
  3885	    originated in a kitchen. The _ante tamen_ of the
  3886	    original belongs to this sentence, not to the next, as
  3887	    the editors have it.
  3888	
  3889	    [3] Wanting in G.-V. The original continues without
  3890	    interruption to the next, an entirely new formula.

  3893	[45] [BRAIN SAUSAGE]
  3894	   [_ISICIA DE CEREBELLIS_] [1]
  3895	
  3896	PUT IN THE MORTAR PEPPER, LOVAGE AND ORIGANY, MOISTEN WITH BROTH AND
  3897	RUB; ADD COOKED BRAINS AND MIX DILIGENTLY SO THAT THERE BE NO LUMPS.
  3898	INCORPORATE FIVE EGGS AND CONTINUE MIXING WELL TO HAVE A GOOD
  3899	FORCEMEAT WHICH YOU MAY THIN WITH BROTH. SPREAD THIS OUT IN A METAL
  3900	PAN, COOK, AND WHEN COOKED [cold] UNMOULD IT ONTO A CLEAN TABLE. CUT
  3901	INTO HANDY SIZE. [Now prepare a sauce] PUT IN THE MORTAR PEPPER,
  3902	LOVAGE AND ORIGANY, CRUSH, MIX WITH BROTH PUT INTO A SAUCE PAN, BOIL,
  3903	THICKEN AND STRAIN. HEAT THE PIECES OF BRAIN PUDDING IN THIS SAUCE
  3904	THOROUGHLY, DISH THEM UP, SPRINKLED WITH PEPPER, IN A MUSHROOM DISH
  3905	[2].
  3906	
  3907	    [1] The Original has no title for this dish.
  3908	
  3909	    [2] List. and G.-V. here start the next formula, but
  3910	    Tor. continues without interruption. Cf. Note 2 to No.

  3912	
  3913	
  3914	[46] A DISH OF SCALLOPS
  3915	   _ISICIA EX SPONDYLIS_ [1]
  3916	
  3917	[Lightly] COOK SCALLOPS [or the firm part of oysters] REMOVE THE HARD
  3918	AND OBJECTIONABLE PARTS, MINCE THE MEAT VERY FINE, MIX THIS WITH
  3919	COOKED SPELT AND EGGS, SEASON WITH PEPPER, [shape into croquettes and
  3920	wrap] IN CAUL, FRY, UNDERLAY A RICH FISH SAUCE AND SERVE AS A
  3921	DELICIOUS ENTRÉE [2].
  3922	
  3923	    [1] Sch. _sfondilis_; G.-V. _sphondylis_; List.
  3924	    _spongiolis_. According to Lister, this is a dish of
  3925	    mushrooms, but he is wrong. He directs to remove sinews
  3926	    when mushrooms haven't any, but shellfish have. Torinus
  3927	    is correct. Gollmer makes the same mistake, believing
  3928	    _spondyli_ to be identical with _spongioli_. He and
  3929	    Danneil take _elixata_ for "choice" when this plainly
  3930	    means "cooked." If one were not sure of either word, the
  3931	    nature of the subject would leave no room for any doubt.
  3932	    Cf. note 1 to Nos. 115-121.
  3933	
  3934	    [2] We may find a reason for the combination of these
  3935	    last three distinctly different formulæ into one article
  3936	    in the following explanation. It is possible that these
  3937	    dishes were served together as one course, even on one
  3938	    platter, thus constituting a single dish, as it were.
  3939	    Such a dish would strongly resemble platters of
  3940	    "_fritures_" and "_fritto misto_" (mixed fried foods)
  3941	    esteemed in France and Italy. We, too, have "Shore
  3942	    Dinners" and other "Combination Platters" with lobster,
  3943	    crabs, scallops, shrimps, mushrooms, tomatoes--each
  3944	    article prepared separately, but when served together
  3945	    will form an integral part of ONE dish.
  3946	
  3947	    The above formulæ, though somewhat incomplete, are good
  3948	    and gastronomically correct. A combination of these
  3949	    _isicia_ such as we here suggest would be entirely
  3950	    feasible and would in fact make a dish of great
  3951	    refinement, taxing the magiric artist's skill to the
  3952	    utmost. We would class them among the _entremets chauds_
  3953	    which are often used on a buffet table or as hot _hors
  3954	    d'œuvres_.
  3955

  3957	[47] ANOTHER KIND OF KROMESKIS [1]
  3958	   _ALITER ISICIA OMENTATA_
  3959	
  3960	FINELY CUT PULP [of pork] IS GROUND WITH THE HEARTS [2] OF WINTER
  3961	WHEAT AND DILUTED WITH WINE. FLAVOR LIGHTLY WITH PEPPER AND BROTH AND
  3962	IF YOU LIKE ADD A MODERATE QUANTITY OF [myrtle] BERRIES ALSO CRUSHED,
  3963	AND AFTER YOU HAVE ADDED CRUSHED NUTS AND PEPPER [3] SHAPE THE
  3964	FORCEMEAT INTO SMALL ROLLS, WRAP THESE IN CAUL, FRY, AND SERVE WITH
  3965	WINE GRAVY.
  3966	
  3967	    [1] Wanting in Lister.
  3968	
  3969	    [2] Fine wheat flour, cream of wheat.
  3970	
  3971	    [3] Either pepper corns or allspice.
  3972	
  3973	    The original leaves us in doubt as to the kind of meat
  3974	    to be used, if any.

  3981	[48] DUMPLINGS OF PHEASANT
  3982	   _ISICIA PLENA_
  3983	
  3984	[Lightly roast choice] FRESH PHEASANTS [cut them into dice and mix
  3985	these with a] STIFF FORCEMEAT MADE OF THE FAT AND THE TRIMMINGS OF THE
  3986	PHEASANT, SEASON WITH PEPPER, BROTH AND REDUCED WINE, SHAPE INTO
  3987	CROQUETTES OR SPOON DUMPLINGS, AND POACH IN HYDROGARUM [water seasoned
  3988	with garum, or even plain salt water].
  3989	
  3990	
  3991	[49] DUMPLINGS AND HYDROGARUM
  3992	   _HYDROGARATA ISICIA_
  3993	
  3994	CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE AND JUST A SUSPICION OF PELLITORY, MOISTEN WITH
  3995	STOCK AND WELL WATER, ALLOW IT TO DRAW, PLACE IT IN A SAUCE PAN, BOIL
  3996	IT DOWN, AND STRAIN. POACH YOUR LITTLE DUMPLINGS OF FORCEMEAT IN THIS
  3997	LIQUOR AND WHEN THEY ARE DONE SERVE IN A DISH FOR ISICIA, TO BE SIPPED
  3998	AT THE TABLE.
  3999	
  4000	
  4001	[50] CHICKEN FORCEMEAT
  4002	   _ISICIA DE PULLO_
  4003	
  4004	[Raw] CHICKEN MEAT, 1 LB. OF DARNEL [1] MEAL, ONE QUARTER PINT OF
  4005	STOCK AND ONE HALF OUNCE OF PEPPER.
  4006	
  4007	    [1] Tor. _lolæ floris_; Hum.-List. and G.-V. _olei
  4008	    floris_--virgin olive oil?--first choice flour? Goll.
  4009	    olive (violet?) flowers; Dann. Olive oil.
  4010	
  4011	    The suggestion of oil is plausible because of the lack
  4012	    of fat in chicken meat, but the quantity--1 lb.--is out
  4013	    of question. Moreover, the binder would be lacking. This
  4014	    is found in the Torinus rendering.
  4015	
  4016	    His _lolæ floris_ should read _lolii_--from
  4017	    _lolium_--darnel rye grass or ray grass which was
  4018	    supposed to have intoxicating qualities, injurious to
  4019	    the eye sight.--Ovid and Plautus. The seeds of this
  4020	    grass were supposed to possess narcotic properties but
  4021	    recent researches have cast doubt upon this theory.
  4022	
  4023	    A little butter, fresh cream and eggs are the proper
  4024	    ingredients for chicken forcemeat. Any kind of flour for
  4025	    binding the forcemeat would cheapen the dish. Yet some
  4026	    modern forcemeats (sausage) contain as much as fifty
  4027	    percent of some kind of meal. The most effective is that
  4028	    of the soya bean which is not starchy.
  4029	
  4030	
  4031	[51] CHICKEN BROTH ANOTHER STYLE
  4032	   _ALITER DE PULLO_
  4033	
  4034	CHICKEN MEAT, 31 PEPPERCORNS CRUSHED, 1 CHOENIX [1] FULL OF THE VERY
  4035	BEST STOCK, A LIKE AMOUNT OF BOILED MUST AND ELEVEN MEASURES [2] OF
  4036	WATER. [Put this in a sauce pan] PLACE IT UPON THE FIRE TO SEETH AND
  4037	EVAPORATE SLOWLY.
  4038	
  4039	    [1] V. 2 _sextarii_; Tor. _chœnicem, cenlicem_; List.
  4040	    _calicem_.
  4041	
  4042	    [2] _chœnices_?--left in doubt.
  4043	
  4044	    This seems to be a chicken broth, or essence for a sauce
  4045	    or perhaps a medicine. Torinus mentions the chicken
  4046	    meat, the others do not.
  4047	
  4048	    The original without interruption continues to describe
  4049	    the _isicium simplex_ which has nothing to do with the
  4050	    above.
  4051	
  4052	
  4053	[52] PLAIN DUMPLING WITH BROTH
  4054	   _ISICIUM SIMPLEX_
  4055	
  4056	TO 1 ACETABULUM [1] OF STOCK [2] ADD 7 OF WATER, A LITTLE GREEN
  4057	CELERY, A LITTLE SPOONFUL OF GROUND PEPPER, AND BOIL THIS WITH THE
  4058	SAUSAGE MEAT OR DUMPLINGS. IF YOU INTEND TAKING THIS TO MOVE THE
  4059	BOWELS THE SEDIMENT SALTS [3] OF HYDROGARUM HAVE TO BE ADDED [4].

  4066	    List. _sales_; G.-V. _fæces_.
  4067	
  4068	    [4] V. The formula is unintelligible, like No. 52 and
  4069	    others, perhaps just another example of medicinal
  4070	    cookery, dishes not only intended to nourish the body
  4071	    but to cure also certain ills. Authors like Hannah
  4072	    Wolley (The Queen-like Closet, London, 1675) and as late
  4073	    as the middle of the 18th century pride themselves in
  4074	    giving such quasi-Apician formulæ.

  4088	
  4089	    _Isicia_, like in the foregoing formula, commences to

  4093	[54] POTTED ENTRÉES
  4094	   _ISICIA AMULATA AB AHENO_ [1]
  4095	
  4096	GROUND PEPPER, LOVAGE, ORIGANY, VERY LITTLE SILPHIUM, A PINCH OF
  4097	GINGER AND A TRIFLE OF HONEY AND A LITTLE STOCK. [Put on the fire,
  4098	and when boiling] ADD THE ISICIA [sausage, meat balls and so forth] TO
  4099	THIS BROTH AND COOK THOROUGHLY. FINALLY THICKEN THE GRAVY WITH ROUX
  4100	[2] BY SOWING IT IN SLOWLY AND STIRRING FROM THE BOTTOM UP [3].
  4101	
  4102	    [1] Tor. _multa ab alieno_; Brandt _[a]mul[a]ta ab
  4103	    aheno_; List. _amylata_--French: _liés_. _Ab aheno_--out
  4104	    of the pot.
  4105	
  4106	    [2] French, for a mixture of wheat or rice flour with
  4107	    fats or liquids to thicken fluids. _Amylum_, or _amulum_
  4108	    which hereafter will occur frequently in the original
  4109	    does not cover the ground as well as the French term
  4110	    _roux_. The quality of the "binder" depends upon the
  4111	    material in hand. Sometimes the fat and flour are
  4112	    parched, sometimes they are used raw. Sometimes the
  4113	    flour is diluted with water and used in that form.
  4114	
  4115	    [3] List. and G.-V. _sorbendum_; Tor. _subruendum_.

  4118	[55] ANOTHER [THICK ENTRÉE GRAVY]
  4119	   _ALITER_
  4120	
  4121	GRIND PEPPER WHICH HAS BEEN SOAKED OVERNIGHT, ADD SOME MORE STOCK AND
  4122	WORK IT INTO A SMOOTH PASTE; THEREUPON ADD QUINCE-APPLE CIDER, BOILED
  4123	DOWN ONE HALF, THAT IS WHICH HAS EVAPORATED IN THE HEAT OF THE SUN TO
  4124	THE CONSISTENCY OF HONEY. IF THIS IS NOT AT HAND, ADD FIG WINE [1]
  4125	CONCENTRATE WHICH THE ROMANS CALL "COLOR" [2]. NOW THICKEN THE GRAVY
  4126	WITH ROUX OR WITH SOAKED RICE FLOUR AND FINISH IT ON A GENTLE FIRE.
  4127	
  4128	    [1] Tor. _cammarum_, which should read _caricarum_--wine
  4129	    of Carica figs.
  4130	
  4131	    [2] V. the Roman equivalent for "_singe_," "monkey,"
  4132	    "_Affe_,"--(the _vulgo_ French is literally translated
  4133	    into and in actual use in other languages) caramel color
  4134	    made of burnt sugar to give gravies a palatable
  4135	    appearance. Cf. No. 73.
  4136	
  4137	    The reference by the original to "which the Romans call
  4138	    'color'" indicates, according to Brandt, that this
  4139	    formula is NOT of ROMAN origin but probably a
  4140	    translation into Latin from a Greek cookery book.
  4141	
  4142	    This is an interesting suggestion, and it could be
  4143	    elaborated on to say that the entire Apicius is NOT of
  4144	    Roman origin. But why should the Greeks who in their
  4145	    balmy days were so far in advance of Rome in culinary
  4146	    matters go there for such information?
  4147	
  4148	    It is more likely that this reference to Rome comes from
  4149	    the Italian provinces or the colonies, regions which

  4170	[57] SPELT OR FARINA PUDDING

  4212	ENTRÉES [2] OF SOW'S MATRIX [3] ARE MADE THUS: CRUSH PEPPER AND CUMIN

  4225	
  4226	    [3] V. _Vulvula_, dim. for _vulva_, sow's matrix. Cf.
  4227	    _vulva_ in dictionary. Possible, also possible that
  4228	    _volva_ is meant--a meat roll, a croquette.
  4229

  4231	    vogue today; we use the green pistachios.
  4232	
  4233	    [5] V. The casings which were filled with this forcemeat
  4234	    may have been the sow's matrices, also caul. The
  4235	    original is vague on the point.

  4238	[60] LITTLE SAUSAGE

  4243	CASINGS AND COOK IN BROTH AND WINE [5].
  4244	
  4245	    [1] V. _Botelli_, or _botuli_, are sausage of various
  4246	    kind; (French, Boudin, English, Pudding). Originally
  4247	    made of raw blood, they are in fact, miniature blood
  4248	    sausage. The absence of meat in the present formula
  4249	    makes me believe that it is not complete, though hard
  4250	    boiled yolk when properly seasoned and mixed with the
  4251	    right amount of fat, make a tasty forcemeat for sausage.
  4252

  4460	
  4461	SCRUB AND WASH BUNDLES OF BEETS BY RUBBING THEM WITH A LITTLE SODA

  4467	
  4468	    [1] This formula wanting in Tor.
  4469	
  4470	    [2] V. Ingenious method to skin tender root vegetables,
  4471	    still in vogue today. We remove the skin of tender young
  4472	    root vegetables, carrots, beets, etc., by placing them
  4473	    in a towel, sprinkling them with rock salt and shaking
  4474	    them energetically. The modern power vegetable peeler is
  4475	    really built on the same principle, only instead of salt
  4476	    (which soon melts) carborundum or rough concrete
  4477	    surfaces are used, against which surfaces the vegetables
  4478	    are hurled by the rotary motion; often enough, too much
  4479	    of the skin is removed, however.

  4485	VARRO BEETS, THAT IS, BLACK ONES [2] OF WHICH THE ROOTS MUST BE
  4486	CLEANED WELL, COOK THEM WITH MEAD AND A LITTLE SALT AND OIL; BOIL THEM
  4487	DOWN IN THIS LIQUOR SO THAT THE ROOTS ARE SATURATED THEREBY; THE

  4498	[71] ANOTHER LAXATIVE
  4499	   _ALITER AD VENTREM_
  4500	
  4501	ANOTHER VEGETABLE DISH, PROMOTING GOOD HEALTH; WASH CELERY, GREENS AND
  4502	ROOTS, AND DRY IT IN THE SUN: THEN ALSO COOK THE TENDER PART AND HEAD
  4503	OF LEEKS IN A NEW [1] POT, ALLOWING THE WATER TO BOIL DOWN ONE THIRD
  4504	OF ITS VOLUME. THEREUPON GRIND PEPPER WITH BROTH AND HONEY IN EQUAL
  4505	AMOUNTS PROPERLY MEASURED, MIX IT IN THE MORTAR WITH THE WATER OF THE
  4506	COOKED CELERY, STRAIN, BOIL AGAIN AND USE IT TO MASK THE [cooked]
  4507	CELERY WITH. IF DESIRED, ADD [the sliced root of the] CELERY TO IT
  4508	[2].
  4509	
  4510	    [1] V. "new," i.e., cook leeks in a separate sauce pan;
  4511	    NOT together with the celery, which, as the original
  4512	    takes for granted, must be cooked also.
  4513	
  4514	    [2] V. We would leave the honey out, make a cream sauce
  4515	    from the stock, or, adding bouillon, tie same with a
  4516	    little flour and butter, and would call the dish Stewed
  4517	    Celery and Leeks. The ancient method is entirely
  4518	    rational because the mineral salts of the vegetables are
  4519	    preserved and utilized (invariably observed by Apicius)
  4520	    which today are often wasted by inexperienced cooks who
  4521	    discard these precious elements with the water in which
  4522	    vegetables are boiled.

  4527	
  4528	
  4529	[72] ASPARAGUS
  4530	   _ASPARAGOS_
  4531	
  4532	ASPARAGUS [Tor. IN ORDER TO HAVE IT MOST AGREEABLE TO THE PALATE] MUST
  4533	BE [peeled, washed and] DRIED [1] AND IMMERSED IN BOILING WATER
  4534	BACKWARDS [2] [3].
  4535	
  4536	    [1] V. Must be dried before boiling because the cold
  4537	    water clinging to the stalks is likely to chill the
  4538	    boiling water too much in which the asparagus is to be
  4539	    cooked. Apicius here reveals himself as the consummate
  4540	    cook who is familiar with the finest detail of physical
  4541	    and chemical changes which food undergoes at varying
  4542	    temperatures.
  4543	
  4544	    The various editions all agree: _asparagos siccabis_;
  4545	    Schuch, however, says: "For the insane _siccabis_ I
  4546	    substitute _siciabis_, _isiciabis_, prepare with _sicio_
  4547	    [?] and cook." He even goes on to interpret it _cucabis_
  4548	    from the Greek _kouki_, cocoanut milk, and infers that
  4549	    the asparagus was first cooked in cocoanut milk and then
  4550	    put back into water, a method we are tempted to
  4551	    pronounce insane.
  4552	
  4553	    [2] V. Backwards! G.-V. _rursum in calidam_; Tac.
  4554	    _rursus in aquam calidam_; Tor. _ac rursus ..._
  4555	
  4556	    This word has caused us some reflection, but the ensuing
  4557	    discovery made it worth while. _Rursus_ has escaped the
  4558	    attention of the other commentators. In this case
  4559	    _rursus_ means backwards, being a contraction from
  4560	    _revorsum_, h.e. _reversum_. The word is important
  4561	    enough to be observed.
  4562	
  4563	    Apicius evidently has the right way of cooking the fine
  4564	    asparagus. The stalks, after being peeled and washed
  4565	    must be bunched together and tied according to sizes,
  4566	    and the bunches must be set into the boiling water
  4567	    "backwards," that is, they must stand upright with the
  4568	    heads protruding from the water. The heads will be made
  4569	    tender above the water line by rising steam and will be
  4570	    done simultaneously with the harder parts of the stalks.
  4571	    We admit, we have never seen a modern cook observe this
  4572	    method. They usually boil the tender heads to death
  4573	    while the lower stalks are still hard.
  4574	
  4575	    Though this formula is incomplete (it fails to state the
  4576	    sauce to be served, also that the asparagus must be
  4577	    peeled and bunched, that the water must contain salt,
  4578	    etc.) it is one of the neatest formulæ in Apicius. It is
  4579	    amusing to note how the author herein unconsciously
  4580	    reveals what a poor litérateur but what a fine cook he
  4581	    is. This is characteristic of most good practitioners.
  4582	    One may perfectly master the vast subject of cookery,
  4583	    yet one may not be able to give a definition of even a
  4584	    single term, let alone the ability to exactly describe
  4585	    one of the many processes of cookery. Real poets often
  4586	    are in the same predicament; none of them ever explained
  4587	    the art satisfactorily.
  4588	
  4589	    [3] G.-V. add to the formula _callosiores reddes_--give
  4590	    back [eliminate] the harder ones. This sentence belongs
  4591	    to the next article. And Torinus, similar to
  4592	    Humelbergius, renders this sentence _ut reddas ad gustum
  4593	    calliores_--to render the harder ones palatable--the
  4594	    squash and pumpkin namely--and we are inclined to agree
  4595	    with him.

  4811	    [3] Cumin or carraway seed is still used today in the

  4816	[88] ANOTHER WAY

  4821	CONDENSED WINE AND A LITTLE OIL.
  4822	
  4823	    Very sensible way of using cabbage stalks that are
  4824	    usually thrown away. Note the almost scientific
  4825	    procedure: the stalks are separated from the leaves,
  4826	    split to facilitate cooking; they are cooked separately
  4827	    because they require more time than the tender greens.
  4828	
  4829	    Our present method appears barbarous in comparison. We
  4830	    quarter the cabbage head, and either boil it or steam
  4831	    it. As a result either the tender leaves are cooked to
  4832	    death or the stems are still hard. The overcooked parts
  4833	    are not palatable, the underdone ones indigestible. Such
  4834	    being the case, our boiled cabbage is a complete loss,
  4835	    unless prepared the Apician way.

  4874	
  4875	    [1] The nuts should not astonish us. The French today
  4876	    have a delicious dish, _Choux de Bruxelles aux
  4877	    Marrons_--Brussels Sprouts with Chestnuts. Sprouts and
  4878	    chestnuts are, of course, cooked separately; the lightly
  4879	    boiled sprouts are _sauté_ in butter; the chestnuts
  4880	    parboiled, peeled, and finished in stock with a little
  4881	    sugar or syrup, tossed in butter and served in the
  4882	    center of the sprouts.
  4883	
  4884	    The Apician formula with cereal and raisins added is too
  4885	    exotic to suit our modern taste, but without a question
  4886	    is a nutritious dish and complete from a dietetic point
  4887	    of view.

  5042	    (at least prior to the 1503 Tac. ed.) is generally not

  5223	
  5224	    [2] Goll. ignores this passage completely.

  5226	    V. This is another of the medical formulæ that have
  5227	    suffered much by experimentation and interpretation

  5375	    "scallops" or the muscular part of any bivalve, at least
  5376	    in the above formula.
  5377	
  5378	    The Græco-Latin word for cow-parsnip is _spondylium_,

  5380	    the preceding parsnips formulæ are in the right place
  5381	    here. They are in direct line with the other vegetables
  5382	    here treated--the shellfish--_spondylus_--would be out
  5383	    of place in this chapter, Book III, The Gardener. All
  5384	    the recipes, with the exception of the above, fit a
  5385	    vegetable like parsnips. Even Lister's and Humelberg's
  5386	    interpretation of the term, who read
  5387	    _spongioli_--mushrooms--could be questioned under this
  5388	    heading, Book III.
  5389	
  5390	    It is barely possible that this entire series of
  5391	    formulæ, _Spondyli uel fonduli_ (℞ Nos. 115-121) does
  5392	    belong to Book II among the scallop _hysitia_, though we
  5393	    are little inclined to accept this theory.

  5519	
  5520	    [6] This dish if pork were added (cf. Sch. in note 4
  5521	    above) would resemble our modern "headcheese"; the
  5522	    presence of cheese in this formula and in our word
  5523	    "headcheese" is perhaps not accidental; the cheese has
  5524	    been eliminated in the course of time from dishes of
  5525	    this sort while the name has remained with us. "Cheese"
  5526	    also appears in the German equivalent for
  5527	    custard--_Eierkäse_.

  5530	[126] APICIAN JELLY
  5531	    _SALACATTABIA APICIANA_
  5532	
  5533	PUT IN THE MORTAR CELERY SEED, DRY PENNYROYAL, DRY MINT, GINGER, FRESH
  5534	CORIANDER, SEEDLESS RAISINS, HONEY, VINEGAR, OIL AND WINE; CRUSH IT
  5535	TOGETHER [in order to make a dressing of it]. [Now] PLACE 3 PIECES OF
  5536	PICENTIAN BREAD IN A MOULD, INTERLINED WITH PIECES OF [cooked]
  5537	CHICKEN, [cooked] SWEETBREADS OF CALF OR LAMB, CHEESE [1], PIGNOLIA
  5538	NUTS, CUCUMBERS [pickles] FINELY CHOPPED DRY ONIONS [shallots]
  5539	COVERING THE WHOLE WITH [jellified] BROTH. BURY THE MOULD IN SNOW UP
  5540	TO THE RIM; [unmould] SPRINKLE [with the above dressing] AND SERVE
  5541	[2].
  5542	
  5543	    [1] List. _caseum Vestinum_--a certain cheese from the
  5544	    Adriatic coast.
  5545	
  5546	    [2] The nature of the first passage of this formula
  5547	    indicates a dressing for a cold dish. The dish was
  5548	    probably unmoulded when firm, and the jelly covered with
  5549	    this dressing, though the original does not state this
  5550	    procedure. In that case it would resemble a highly
  5551	    complicated chicken salad, such as we make
  5552	    today--_mayonnaise de volaille en aspic_, for instance.
  5553	    We recall the artistic molds for puddings and other
  5554	    dishes which the ancients had which were nicely suited
  5555	    for dishes such as the above.
  5556	
  5557	    The Picentian bread--made of spelt--was a celebrated
  5558	    product of the bakeries of Picentia, a town of lower
  5559	    Italy, near the Tuscan sea, according to Pliny.

  5578	    [3] A panada as is found in every old cookery book.
  5579	    Today it remains as a dressing for roast fowl, etc.
  5580	    Quoting from "A Collection of Receipts in Cookery,
  5581	    Physick and Surgery," London, 1724:
  5582	
  5583	    "Panada for a Sick or Weak Stomach. Put the crumbs of a
  5584	    Penny White-Loaf grated into a Quart of cold Water, set
  5585	    both on the Fire together with a blade of Mace: When
  5586	    'tis boil'd smooth, take it off the fire and put in a
  5587	    bit of Lemon-peel, the juice of a Lemon, a glass of Sack
  5588	    [Spanish Wine] and Sugar to your Taste. This is very
  5589	    Nourishing and never offends the Stomach. Some season
  5590	    with butter and Sugar, adding Currants which on some
  5591	    occasions are proper; but the first is the most grateful
  5592	    and innocent."
  5593	
  5594	    Mrs. Glasse, a quarter century later, in her famous book
  5595	    [The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy, London, 1747,
  5596	    1st ed.] omits the wine, but Mrs. Mason, at about the
  5597	    same time, insists on having it with panada.
  5598	
  5599	    The imaginary or real relation between the sciences of
  5600	    cookery and medicine is illustrated here.

  5635	    which is the thing to do. Cf. No. 143, practically a
  5636	    repetition of this. Cf. 301.
  5637	
  5638	    [3] This laconic formula indicates a custard poached,
  5639	    like in the preceding, in a mould, which, when cooled
  5640	    off, is unmoulded in the usual way. This _patina
  5641	    versatilis_ is in fact the modern _crême renversée_,
  5642	    with nuts.
  5643	
  5644	    It is characteristic of Apicius for incompleteness and
  5645	    want of precise directions, without which the experiment
  5646	    in the hands of an inexperienced operator would result
  5647	    in failure.

  5666	OFF AND DRAIN THEM. TAKE 4 [calf's] BRAINS, REMOVE [the skin and]
  5667	STRINGS AND COOK THEM [4] IN THE MORTAR PUT 6 SCRUPLES OF PEPPER,
  5668	MOISTEN WITH BROTH AND CRUSH FINE; THEN ADD THE BRAINS, RUB AGAIN AND
  5669	MEANWHILE ADD THE VEGETABLES, RUBBING ALL THE WHILE, AND MAKE A FINE
  5670	PASTE OF IT. THEREUPON BREAK AND ADD 8 EGGS. NOW ADD A GLASSFUL [5] OF
  5671	BROTH, A GLASSFUL OF WINE, A GLASSFUL OF RAISIN WINE, TASTE THIS
  5672	PREPARATION. OIL THE BAKING DISH THOROUGHLY [put the mixture in the
  5673	dish] AND PLACE IT IN THE HOT PLATE, (THAT IS ABOVE THE HOT ASHES) [6]
  5674	AND WHEN IT IS DONE [unmould it] SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE [7].

  5678	
  5679	    _Patina frisilis_ remains unexplained. None of the
  5680	    various readings can be satisfactorily rendered. If the
  5681	    vegetables had remained whole the dish might be compared
  5682	    to a _chartreuse_, those delightful creations by the
  5683	    Carthusian monks who compelled by the strictest rules of
  5684	    vegetarianism evolved a number of fine vegetable dishes.
  5685	    On the other hand, the poached mixture of eggs and
  5686	    brains is akin to our _farces_ and _quenelles_; but in
  5687	    modern cookery we have nothing just like this _patina
  5688	    frisilis_.

  5816	    [3] Tor. continues ℞ No. 135 without interruption or
  5817	    caption, and describes the above recipe. He reads: _De
  5818	    thoris accipies rosas_, but List. insists that _de
  5819	    thoris_ be read _de rosis_; Lan., Tac. _de toris_; V.
  5820	    _de thoris_ may be read "fresh from the flower bed."
  5821	
  5822	    Cf. ℞ Nos. 167 and 171 in which case the "rose" may
  5823	    stand for rosy apple, or "Roman Beauty" apple. "Rose
  5824	    apple" also is a small pimento, size of a plum.

  5837	
  5838	    [3] Modern English recipes for stewed pumpkin resemble
  5839	    this Apician precept, but America has made a really
  5840	    palatable dish from pumpkin by the addition of eggs,
  5841	    cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger--spices which the insipid
  5842	    pumpkin needs. The ancient original may have omitted the
  5843	    eggs because Apicius probably expected his formula to be
  5844	    carried out in accordance with the preceding formulæ.
  5845	    Perhaps this is proven by the fact that Tor. continues
  5846	    the Rose Pie recipe with _et cucurbita patina sic fiet_.

  5867	
  5868	    [4] Excellent formula for fish in white wine, resembling
  5869	    our ways of making this fine dish.
  5870	
  5871	    This again illustrates the laconic style of the ancient
  5872	    author. He omitted to say that the fish, when cooked,
  5873	    was placed on the service platter and that the juices
  5874	    remaining in the sauce pan were tied with one or two egg
  5875	    yolks, diluted with cream, or wine, or _court bouillon_,
  5876	    strained and poured over the fish at the moment of
  5877	    serving. This is perhaps the best method of preparing
  5878	    fish with white meat of a fine texture. Pink or darker
  5879	    fish do not lend themselves to this method of
  5880	    preparation.

  5895	
  5896	    [1] Tac., Tor. _sic_. List., G.-V. _p. de apua sine
  5897	    apua_--a dish of anchovies (or smelts) without
  5898	    anchovies. Tor. formula bears the title _patina de
  5899	    apua_, and his article opens with the following
  5900	    sentence: _patin de abua sive apua sic facies_. He is
  5901	    therefore quite emphatic that the dish is to be made
  5902	    with the _abua_ or _apua_ (an anchovy) and not without
  5903	    _apua_, as List. has it. Lan. calls the dish: P. _de
  5904	    apabadiade_, not identified.
  5905	
  5906	    [2] Tor. _impones ad uaporem ut cum ouis meare
  5907	    possint_--warning, get along with the eggs, i.e. beware
  5908	    of boiling them for they will curdle, and the experiment
  5909	    is hopelessly lost. List. however, reads _meare possint_
  5910	    thus: _bullire p._--boil (!) It is quite plain that Tor.
  5911	    has the correct formula.
  5912	
  5913	    [3] _et ex esu nemo agnoscet quid manducet._ Dann.
  5914	    renders this sentence thus: "Nobody can value this dish
  5915	    unless he has partaken of it himself." He is too
  5916	    lenient. We would rather translate it literally as we
  5917	    did above, or say broadly, "And nobody will be any the
  5918	    wiser." List. dwells at length upon this sentence; his
  5919	    erudite commentary upon the _cena dubia_, the doubtful
  5920	    meal, will be found under the heading of _cena_ in our
  5921	    vocabulary. List. pp. 126-7. List. undoubtedly made the
  5922	    mistake of reading _sine_ for _sive_. He therefore
  5923	    omitted the _apua_ from his formula. The above boastful
  5924	    sentence may have induced him to do so.
  5925	
  5926	    The above is a fish forcemeat, now seldom used as an
  5927	    integral dish, but still popular as a dressing for fish
  5928	    or as quenelles. The modern fish forcemeat is usually
  5929	    made of raw fish, cream and eggs, with the necessary
  5930	    seasoning. The material is poached or cooked much in the
  5931	    same manner as prescribed by the ancient recipe.

  6130	    Probably a common sturgeon, or porpoise, or dolphin.
  6131	    List. describes it as "a kind of salt fish from the
  6132	    Black Sea; a malicious fish with a mouth similar to a
  6133	    rabbit"; Dann. thinks it is a sturgeon, but in Goll. it
  6134	    appears as tunny. The ancients called the sturgeon
  6135	    _acipenser_; but this name was gradually changed into
  6136	    _styrio_, _stirio_ and _sturio_, which is similar to
  6137	    _tursio_ (cf. _styrio_ in the vocabulary). The fish in
  6138	    question therefore may have been sturgeon for which the

  6145	
  6146	    The above is an excellent way of making fish balls, it
  6147	    being taken for granted, of course, that the salt fish
  6148	    be thoroughly soaked and cooked in milk before shaping
  6149	    into balls. The many spices should be used very
  6150	    moderately, some to be omitted entirely. We read between
  6151	    the lines of the old formula that the _Tursio_ had a
  6152	    long journey from Pontus to Rome; fish however dry
  6153	    acquires a notorious flavor upon such journeys which
  6154	    must be offset by herbs and spices.
  6155	
  6156	    It is quite possible that the ancients made a
  6157	    _réduction_ of the herbs and spices mentioned in this
  6158	    formula; in fact, the presence of vinegar leads us to
  6159	    believe this, in which case this formula would be
  6160	    nothing but a very modern sauce. The herbs and spices in
  6161	    a _réduction_ are crushed and boiled down in vinegar and
  6162	    wine, and strained off, they leave their finest flavor
  6163	    in the sauce.

  6166	[146] VEGETABLE DINNER
  6167	    _PATELLA EX OLISATRO_ [1]
  6168	
  6169	[Any kind of vegetables or herbs] BLANCHED OFF IN WATER WITH [a
  6170	little] SODA; SQUEEZE [out the water] ARRANGE IN A SAUCEPAN. GRIND
  6171	PEPPER, LOVAGE, CORIANDER, SATURY, ONION WITH WINE, BROTH, VINEGAR AND
  6172	OIL; ADD [this] TO THE VEGETABLES, STEW [all until nearly done] AND
  6173	TIE WITH ROUX. SPRINKLE WITH THYME, FINELY GROUND PEPPER AND SERVE.
  6174	ANY KIND OF VEGETABLE [2] MAY BE PREPARED IN THE ABOVE MANNER, IF YOU
  6175	WISH.
  6176	
  6177	    [1] Wanting in Tac. and Tor. G.-V. _patellam ex
  6178	    holisatro_.
  6179	
  6180	    [2] It is worth noting that Tor. and Tac. omit this
  6181	    recipe entirely and that Tor. concludes the preceding
  6182	    formula with the last sentence of the above formula,
  6183	    except for the difference in one word. Tor. _et de
  6184	    quacunque libra_ [List. _et al._ _herba_] _si volueris
  6185	    facies ut demonstratum est suprà_. This might mean that
  6186	    it is optional (in the preceding formula) to shape the
  6187	    fish into one pound loaves instead of the small fish
  6188	    balls, which is often done in the case of forcemeats, as
  6189	    in veal, beef, ham loaves, or fish pie.
  6190	
  6191	    We are inclined to accept the reading of Torinus, for
  6192	    the above way of preparing "any kind of vegetables or
  6193	    herbs" is somewhat farfetched. Furthermore, the
  6194	    vegetable dish would more properly belong in Book III.
  6195	
  6196	    Just another example of where readings by various
  6197	    editors are different because of the interpretations of
  6198	    one word. In this case one group reads _libra_ whereas
  6199	    the other reads _herba_.
  6200	
  6201	
  6202	[147] A DISH OF SARDINES
  6203	    _PATELLA DE APUA_ [1]
  6204	
  6205	SARDINE LOAF (OR OMELETTE) IS MADE IN THIS MANNER [2] CLEAN THE
  6206	SARDINES [of skin and bones]; BREAK [and beat] EGGS AND MIX WITH [half
  6207	of the] FISH [3]; ADD TO THIS SOME STOCK, WINE AND OIL, AND FINISH
  6208	[the composition] BY HEATING IT. WHEN DONE TO A POINT, ADD [the
  6209	remaining part of the] SARDINES TO IT, LET IT STAND A WHILE [over a
  6210	slow fire to congeal] CAREFULLY TURN OVER [dish it up] MASK WITH A
  6211	WARM [4] WINE SAUCE, SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.
  6212	
  6213	    [1] G.-V. _Patina de apua fricta_--same as _aphya_,
  6214	    fried fresh small fish of the kind of anchovies,
  6215	    sardines, sprats.
  6216	
  6217	    In experimenting with this formula we would advise to
  6218	    use salt and oil judiciously if any at all. We have no
  6219	    knowledge of the ancient _apua fricta_ other than our
  6220	    making of modern sardines which is to fry them in oil as
  6221	    quickly as possible after the fish has left the water,
  6222	    for its meat is very delicate. For an omelette, our
  6223	    modern sardines, including kippered smelts, sprotten,
  6224	    and similar smoked and processed fish, contain
  6225	    sufficient salt and fat to season the eggs of an
  6226	    omelette.
  6227	
  6228	    [2] Tor. Sentence wanting in other texts.
  6229	
  6230	    [3] Tor. _cum aqua_; List., G.-V. _cum apua_. Perhaps a
  6231	    typographical error in Tor. A little water is used to
  6232	    dilute the eggs of an omelette, but Apicius already
  6233	    prescribes sufficient liquids (stock or brine, wine) for
  6234	    that purpose.
  6235	
  6236	    [4] Tor. _et in calore œnogarum perfundes_; List.,
  6237	    G.-V. _ut coloret_--to keep the omelette in the pan long
  6238	    enough to give it "color." We prefer the Torinus version
  6239	    because an omelette should have no or very little color
  6240	    from the fire (the eggs thus browned are indigestible)
  6241	    and because hot _œnogarum_ (wine-fish sauce, not in
  6242	    List.) is accompanying this dish, to give additional
  6243	    savour and a finishing touch.
  6244	
  6245	
  6246	[148] FINE RAGOUT OF BRAINS AND BACON
  6247	    _PATINA EX LARIDIS _[1]_ ET CEREBELLIS_
  6248	
  6249	THE DISH OF BACON AND BRAINS IS MADE IN THIS MANNER [2] STRAIN [or
  6250	chop fine] HARD BOILED EGGS [3] WITH PARBOILED BRAINS [calf's or
  6251	pig's] THE SKIN AND NERVES OF WHICH HAVE BEEN REMOVED; ALSO COOK
  6252	CHICKEN GIBLETS, ALL IN PROPORTION TO THE FISH [4] PUT THIS AFORESAID
  6253	MIXTURE IN A SAUCEPAN, PLACE THE COOKED BACON IN THE CENTER, GRIND
  6254	PEPPER AND LOVAGE AND TO SWEETEN ADD A DASH OF MEAD, HEAT, WHEN HOT
  6255	STIR BRISKLY WITH A RUE WHIP AND BIND WITH ROUX.
  6256	
  6257	    [1] G.-V. _lagitis_; Tor. _laridis_ and _largitis_; Vat.
  6258	    Ms. _lagatis_; List. _pro lagitis ... legendum
  6259	    Lacertis_. The _lacertus_, according to List., is a much
  6260	    esteemed salt fish; not identified. List. _et al._ seem
  6261	    to be mistaken in their reading of _lacertis_ for
  6262	    _laridis_. This work stands for salt pork, from
  6263	    _laridum_ and _lardum_ (French, _lard_; the English
  6264	    _lard_ is applied to the rendered fat of pork in
  6265	    general). Cf. notes to ℞ No. 41.
  6266	
  6267	    [2] Tor. sentence wanting in other texts.
  6268	
  6269	    [3] _oua dura_; Sch. _o. dua_--two eggs.
  6270	
  6271	    [4] This formula would be intelligible and even
  6272	    gastronomically correct were it not for this word
  6273	    "fish." However, we cannot accept Lister's reading
  6274	    _lacertis_. We prefer the reading, _laridis_, bacon. The
  6275	    French have another term for this--_petits salés_. Both
  6276	    this and the Torinus term are in the plural. They are
  6277	    simply small strips of bacon to which Torinus again
  6278	    refers in the above formula, _salsum, coctum in media
  6279	    pones_--put the bacon, when done, in the center (of the
  6280	    dish). Regarding _salsum_ also see note to ℞ No. 41.
  6281	
  6282	    The above dish resembles _ragoût fin en coquille_, a
  6283	    popular Continental dish, although its principal
  6284	    ingredients are sweetbreads instead of brains.
  6285

  6287	[149] BROILED MULLET

  6299	    than carrying owls to Athens. As a matter of fact, the
  6300	    mullet if it be what List. says, _loco salsi_--salted on
  6301	    the spot, i.e. as caught, near the sea shore, requires
  6302	    soaking to extract the salt.
  6303	
  6304	
  6305	[150] A DISH OF ANY KIND OF SALT FISH
  6306	    _PATINA EX PISCIBUS QUIBUSLIBET_ [1]

  6313

  6316	    [2] Tor.; sentence wanting in other texts.
  6317	
  6318	    [3] Tor. _duratos_--_hard_--no sense here, probably a
  6319	    misprint of the d. List. _curatos_--carefully treated,
  6320	    "cured," processed.
  6321	
  6322	    [4] _Salsum coctum_, cf. notes to ℞ No. 148; Goll.,
  6323	    Dann.--sprinkle [the fish] with salt.... Like Lister's
  6324	    error in the preceding formula it would be a great
  6325	    blunder to add salt to a cured fish already saturated
  6326	    with salt to the utmost. Cf. also note 2 to ℞ Nos.
  6327	    41, 148.
  6328

  6350	SAUCEPAN WITH A LITTLE BROTH, SOME OIL AND WATER, AND, TO BE COOKED
  6351	[with the onions] PLACE SALT PORK [3] IN THE MIDST [of the scallions].
  6352	WHEN NEARLY DONE, ADD A SPOON OF HONEY [4] A LITTLE VINEGAR AND
  6353	REDUCED MUST, TASTE IT, IF INSIPID ADD MORE BRINE [broth] IF TOO
  6354	SALTY, ADD MORE HONEY, AND SPRINKLE WITH SAVORY [5].
  6355	
  6356	    [1] Dann. Named for Lucretius Epicuræus, a contemporary
  6357	    of Cicero. List. _ab authore cui in usu fuit sic
  6358	    appellata_.
  6359	
  6360	    [2] G.-V. _concides_. Not necessary.
  6361	
  6362	    [3] _salsum crudum_--salt pork, i.e. not smoked or cured
  6363	    bacon. Dann. raw salt; Goll. salt. Impossible, of
  6364	    course! Cf. notes to ℞ Nos. 41, 147, 149.
  6365	
  6366	    [4] To glaze the pork, no doubt; reminding us of our own
  6367	    use of sugar to glaze ham or bacon, and of the molasses
  6368	    added to pork (and beans).
  6369	
  6370	    [5] G.-V. _coronam bubulam_. In experimenting with this
  6371	    formula omit salt completely. Instead of honey we have
  6372	    also added maple syrup once. To make this a perfect
  6373	    luncheon dish a starch is wanting; we have therefore
  6374	    added sliced raw potatoes and cooked with the rest, to
  6375	    make it a balanced meal, by way of improving upon
  6376	    Lucretius. Since the ancients had no potatoes we have,
  6377	    on a different occasion, created another version by
  6378	    added sliced dasheens (_colocasia_, cf. ℞ Nos. 74,
  6379	    216, 244, 322). It is surprising that the ancients who
  6380	    used the _colocasium_ extensively did not combine it
  6381	    with the above dish.
  6382	
  6383	
  6384	[153] STEWED LACERTUS FISH
  6385	    _PATINA DE LACERTIS_ [1]
  6386	
  6387	CLEAN AND WASH [soak] THE FISH [2] [cook and flake it] BREAK AND BEAT
  6388	EGGS, MIX THEM WITH THE FISH, ADD BROTH, WINE AND OIL. PLACE THIS ON
  6389	THE FIRE, WHEN COOKED [scrambled] ADD SIMPLE FISH WINE SAUCE [3] TO
  6390	IT, SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE [4].
  6391	
  6392	    [1] Ex List. wanting in Tor. G.-V. _P. de lagitis_; cf.
  6393	    note to ℞ No. 148.
  6394	
  6395	    [2] Remembering that List. reads _lagitis_ for
  6396	    _lacertis_, this formula appears to be an antique
  6397	    "Scrambled Eggs and Bacon." Cf. notes to ℞ Nos. 42,
  6398	    148-150.
  6399	
  6400	    [3] _Oenogarum_, cf. ℞ No. 147, the Sardine Omelette.
  6401	
  6402	    [4] To cook the eggs as described above would be
  6403	    disastrous. The fish, if such was used, was probably
  6404	    first poached in the broth, wine and oil, and when done,
  6405	    removed from the pan. The _fond_, or remaining juice or
  6406	    gravy, was subsequently tied with the egg yolks, and
  6407	    this sauce was strained over the fish dressed on the
  6408	    service platter, the _œnogarum_ sparingly sprinkled
  6409	    over the finished dish. This would closely resemble our
  6410	    modern _au vin blanc_ fish dishes; the _œnogarum_
  6411	    taking the place of our meat glacé.
  6412	
  6413	    Another interpretation of this vexatious formula is that
  6414	    if fish was used, the cooked fish was incorporated with
  6415	    the raw beaten eggs which were then scrambled in the
  6416	    pan. In that event this formula resembles closely the
  6417	    sardine omelette.

  6676	    [3] _testiculi caponum_; the capon has no _testiculi_,
  6677	    these organs having been removed by an operation when
  6678	    the cock is young. This operation is said to have been
  6679	    first performed by a Roman surgeon with the intention of
  6680	    beating the _Lex Fannia_, or Fannian law, sponsored by a
  6681	    fanatic named Fannius. It prohibited among other
  6682	    restrictions the serving of any fowl at any time or
  6683	    repast except a hen, and this hen was not to be
  6684	    fattened. Note the cunning of the law: The useful hen
  6685	    and her unlaid eggs could be sacrificed while the
  6686	    unproductive rooster was allowed to thrive to no
  6687	    purpose, immune from the butcher's block. This set the
  6688	    shrewd surgeon to thinking; he transformed a rooster
  6689	    into a capon by his surgical trick. The emasculated bird
  6690	    grew fat without his owner committing any infraction of
  6691	    the Roman law against fattening chickens. Of course the
  6692	    capon, being neither hen nor rooster, was perfectly safe
  6693	    to eat, for he was within the law. Thus he became a huge
  6694	    success as an ancient "bootleg" chicken.
  6695	
  6696	    [4] These integral parts must be prepared and poached
  6697	    separately and merely heated together before the final
  6698	    service.

  6705	    of puff paste.

  6724	    De re Rustica, lib. XII, Cap. XLIIII.
  6725	
  6726	    This is not the first instance where fruits or
  6727	    vegetables were named for famous men. Beets, a certain
  6728	    kind of them were named for Varro, writer on
  6729	    agriculture. Matius, according to Varro, wrote a book on
  6730	    waiters, cooks, cellar men and food service in general,
  6731	    of which there is no trace today. It was already lost
  6732	    during Varro's days.

  6742	HEADS AND GREEN CORIANDER, COOKED PORK SHOULDER, SMALL TID-BITS. WHILE
  6743	THIS IS BEING COOKED, CRUSH PEPPER, CUMIN, CORIANDER OR [its] SEEDS,
  6744	GREEN RUE, LASER ROOT, MOISTENED WITH VINEGAR, REDUCED MUST AND THE
  6745	GRAVY OF THE ABOVE MORSELS; ADD VINEGAR TO TASTE: WHEN THIS [sauce] IS
  6746	COOKED, HOLLOW OUT CITRON SQUASH [3] CUT IN DICE, BOIL AND PLACE THEM
  6747	TOGETHER WITH THE REST IN THE DISH, SKIM, BIND [strain] THE SAUCE
  6748	[pour it over the morsels] SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.
  6749	
  6750	    [1] G.-V. _m. ex citriis_.
  6751	
  6752	    [2] At this late point Apicius commences to use the term
  6753	    _coctura_ which does not designate any particular
  6754	    ingredient but rather stands for a certain process of
  6755	    cookery, depending upon the ingredients used in the
  6756	    dish. We would here interpret it as the frying of the
  6757	    leeks in oil, etc. In another instance _coctura_ may
  6758	    mean our modern _réduction_.
  6759	
  6760	    [3] The fruit to be used here has not been
  6761	    satisfactorily identified. The texts have _citrium_ and
  6762	    _citrum_--a sweet squash or cucumber--perhaps even a
  6763	    melon, but not the citron, the _mala citrea_ as read by
  6764	    List. This specimen is hard to identify because of the
  6765	    many varieties in the cucumber, squash and the citrus
  6766	    families. _Citrus_, as a matter of fact, is but a
  6767	    corruption of _cedrus_, the cedar tree.
  6768	
  6769	    We are not sure whether this fruit is to be stuffed with
  6770	    the ragout and then baked, as is often the custom to do
  6771	    with such shells; the texts prescribes distinctly to
  6772	    hollow out the fruit.
  6773	
  6774	    The title, implying a "sweet dish" is obviously wrong.
  6775	
  6776	    It may be remarked here that Apicius makes no mention of
  6777	    that marvelous citrus fruit, the lemon, nor of the
  6778	    orange, both of which are indispensable to modern
  6779	    cookery.

  6794	    addition of the fruit.

  6830

  6833	
  6834	    Sch. _mala rosea_--rosy or red apple, most likely to be
  6835	    the correct interpretation. Cf. ℞ Nos. 136 and 167.
  6836	
  6837	    The above title has led to the belief that the ancients
  6838	    made pies, etc., of roses, an idea that was much
  6839	    ridiculed in England after the publication of Lister's
  6840	    work in 1705.
  6841	
  6842	    We concur with Schuch's interpretation that rosy apples
  6843	    were used, remembering, however, that the fruit of the
  6844	    rose tree, the hip, dog-briar, eglantine is also made
  6845	    into dainty confections on the Continent today. It is
  6846	    therefore entirely possible that this recipe calls for
  6847	    the fruit of the rose tree.

  7021	    Cucumbers lend themselves equally well for a dish of
  7022	    this kind; they are often stuffed with a forcemeat of
  7023	    finely minced meats, mushrooms, eggs, breadcrumbs, or
  7024	    simply with raw sausage meat, cooked as above, and
  7025	    served as a garnish with _entrées_.

  7032	
  7033	    [4] Whether you like pumpkin and brains or not--Apicius
  7034	    in this dish reveals himself as the consummate master of
  7035	    his art that he really is--a cook for cooks; Moreover,
  7036	    the lucidity of his diction in this instance is equally
  7037	    remarkable. It stands out in striking contrast to his
  7038	    many other formulæ which are so obscured. Many of them
  7039	    perhaps were precepts of likewise striking originality
  7040	    as this one just cited.

  7049	PAN, ADDING A LITTLE OIL. STEW SLOWLY ON A WEAK FIRE, THICKEN [the
  7050	juice] WITH ROUX [rice flour or other starch diluted with water]
  7051	SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER [2] AND SERVE [3].
  7052	
  7053	    [1] Lister praises the early green fruit and the use
  7054	    thereof, and, as a physician, recommends imitation of
  7055	    the above as follows: _In aliis plurimis locis hujus
  7056	    fructus mentio fit; ususque mirabilis fuit; & certe
  7057	    propter salubritatem, nostram imitationem meretur._
  7058	
  7059	    [2] We do not like the "pepper" in this connection and
  7060	    we venture to suggest that in this case the term
  7061	    probably stands for some other kind of aromatic seed
  7062	    less pungent than the grain known to us as "pepper" and
  7063	    one more acceptable to the fine flavor of fruit, namely
  7064	    pimiento, allspice for instance, or clove, or nutmeg, or
  7065	    a mixture of these. "Pepper" formerly was a generic term
  7066	    for all of these spices but was gradually confined to
  7067	    the grain pepper of black and white varieties.
  7068	
  7069	    [3] We concur with Lister's idea of the use of early
  7070	    fruits. The use of early and unripe fruit for this and
  7071	    similar purposes is excellent. The above formula is a
  7072	    good example of our own "spiced" peaches, pears, etc.,
  7073	    usually taken as a relish. Of course, we use sugar
  7074	    instead of honey for sweetening, and brandy instead of
  7075	    wine; but the underlying principles are alike.
  7076	
  7077	    This is a good illustration of and speaks well for the
  7078	    economy and the ingenuity of the ancients.

  7110	Some writers mention wine thus kept for a hundred years; the porosity

  7171	    [2] _Puls_--formerly a simple porridge of various kinds
  7172	    of cereals or legumes, eaten by the Romans before bread
  7173	    came into use. _Puls_ remained in use after the
  7174	    introduction of bread only as a food of the poor. It was
  7175	    also used at sacrifices. The _pultes_ and _pulticulæ_
  7176	    given by Apicius are illustrations of the ever-present
  7177	    desire to improve--to glorify, as it were, a thing which
  7178	    once was or still is of vital importance in the daily
  7179	    life of humans. The _nouveaux-riches_ of the ancient and
  7180	    the modern world cannot find it easy to separate
  7181	    themselves from their traditions nor are they wont to
  7182	    put up with their plainness, hence the fancy trimmings.
  7183	    The development of the American pie is a curious analogy
  7184	    in this respect. We see in this the intricate working of
  7185	    human culture, its eternal strife for perfection. And
  7186	    perfection is synonymous with decay. The fare of the
  7187	    Carthusian monks, professed, stern vegetarians,
  7188	    underwent the same tortuous evolution.
  7189	
  7190	    [3] Named for Didius Julianus, the emperor who was a
  7191	    vegetarian. Of course, his majesty could not live on a
  7192	    plain porridge, hence the Apician artistry. The _pultes_
  7193	    were popular with the many professed vegetarians though
  7194	    the obliging cooks mixed finely ground meat in this and
  7195	    other porridges.

  7197	    Our various cream soups and legume purées--those most

  7354	    tender pea. Some of its refreshing green color is

  7406	    about the utilization of the sow's belly mentioned at
  7407	    the opening of the formula. We assume that the _petaso_
  7408	    can take its place in the dish.
  7409	
  7410	    [7] There is nothing just like this dish in the history
  7411	    of gastronomy, considering both the comparatively cheap
  7412	    materials and the refinement of the gastronomic idea

  7466	    [1] List. _Pisa Vitelliana_--named for Vitellius, ninth
  7467	    Roman emperor, notorious glutton, according to Hum. who
  7468	    says that V. invented this dish: _ab auctore Vitellio
  7469	    Imperatore luxui deditissimo_. But Tor. differs; his
  7470	    _pisum uitellinum_ stands for peas with
  7471	    yolks--_vitellum_--yolk, (also calf) dim. _vitellinum_;
  7472	    Tac. _v----am_. Cf. ℞ No. 193.

  7478	
  7479	    [4] If Vitellius never invented any other dish than this
  7480	    one, his gluttony was overrated. As a gastronomer he may
  7481	    be safely relegated to the vast multitude of ill-advised
  7482	    people whose craving for carbohydrates (which is perhaps
  7483	    pathological) causes them to accumulate a surplus of
  7484	    fat. This was fatal to Vitellius and his faithful court
  7485	    baker who is said to have stuck to his master to the
  7486	    last. The poor emperor's _embonpoint_ proved cumbersome
  7487	    when he fled the infuriated mob. Had he been leaner he
  7488	    might have effected a "getaway." He was dragged through
  7489	    the streets and murdered, Dec. 21 or 22, A.D. 69.

  7774	
  7775	    [3] These apparently outlandish ways of cooking beans
  7776	    compel us to draw a modern parallel in a cookery book,
  7777	    specializing in Jewish dishes. To prove that Apicius is
  7778	    not dead "by a long shot," we shall quote from Wolf,
  7779	    Rebekka: Kochbuch für Israelitische Frauen, Frankfurt,
  7780	    1896, 11th edition. As a matter of fact, Rebekka Wolf is
  7781	    outdoing Apicius in strangeness--a case of _Apicium in
  7782	    ipso Apicio_, as Lister sarcastically remarks of
  7783	    Torinus.
  7784	
  7785	    Rebekka Wolf: ℞ No. 211--wash and boil the young
  7786	    beans in fat _bouillon_ (Apicius: _oleum et liquamen_)
  7787	    adding a handful of chopped pepperwort (A.: _piper,
  7788	    ligusticum_) and later chopped parsley (A.:
  7789	    _petroselinum_) some sugar (A.: _mel pavo_--little
  7790	    honey) and pepper. Beans later in the season are cooked
  7791	    with potatoes. The young beans are tied with flour
  7792	    dissolved in water, or with roux.
  7793	
  7794	    _Id. ibid._, ℞ No. 212, Beans Sweet-Sour. Boil in
  7795	    water, fat, salt, add vinegar, sugar or syrup, "English
  7796	    aromatics" and spices, lemon peel, and a little pepper;
  7797	    bind with roux.
  7798	
  7799	    _Id. ibid._, ℞ No. 213, Cut Pickled Beans
  7800	    (_Schneidebohnen_) prepare as ℞ No. 212, but if you
  7801	    would have them more delicious, take instead of the roux
  7802	    grated chocolate, sugar, cinnamon, lemon peel and lemon
  7803	    juice, and some claret. If not sour enough, add vinegar,
  7804	    but right here you must add more fat; you may lay on top
  7805	    of this dish a bouquet of sliced apples.
  7806	
  7807	    _Id. ibid._, ℞ No. 214, Beans and Pears. Take cut and
  7808	    pickled beans and prepare as above. To this add peeled
  7809	    fresh pears, cut into quarters; then sugar, lemon peel
  7810	    cut thin, cinnamon, "English" mixed spices, and at last
  7811	    the roux, thinned with broth. This dish must be sweet
  7812	    and very fat.
  7813	
  7814	    As for exotic combinations, Apicius surely survives
  7815	    here, is even surpassed by this Jewish cookery book
  7816	    where, no doubt, very ancient traditions have been
  7817	    stored away.

  7866	
  7867	    The purpose of removing the seeds is obscure. G.-V.
  7868	    reads _semine cum ovis_; Tac. _semie_; Hum. _s. cum

  7871	    a salad and other dishes.

  8047	    [2] Remarkable ingenuity! Try this on your turkey legs.
  8048	    Danneil is of the opinion that the head and its feathers
  8049	    were to be saved for decorative purposes, in style
  8050	    during the middle ages when game bird patties were
  8051	    decorated with the fowl's plumage, a custom which
  8052	    survived to Danneil's time (ca. 1900). But this is not
  8053	    likely to be the case here, for it would be a simple
  8054	    matter to skin the bird before cooking it in order to
  8055	    save the plumage for the taxidermist.

  8083	    (_exprimo_, from _ex_ and _premo_) is the proper thing
  8084	    to do from a culinary standpoint.
  8085	
  8086	    [4] The turnips are cooked half, the water removed, and
  8087	    finished with the duck, as prescribed by Apicius. It is
  8088	    really admirable to see how he handles these food
  8089	    materials in order to remove any disagreeable flavor,
  8090	    which may be the case both with the turnips (the small

  8257	[229] TREATMENT OF STRONG SMELLING BIRDS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION
  8258	    _AD AVES HIRCOSAS _[1]_ OMNI GENERE_
  8259	
  8260	FOR BIRDS OF ALL KINDS THAT HAVE A GOATISH [1] SMELL [2] PEPPER,
  8261	LOVAGE, THYME, DRY MINT, SAGE, DATES, HONEY, VINEGAR, WINE, BROTH,
  8262	OIL, REDUCED MUST, MUSTARD. THE BIRDS WILL BE MORE LUSCIOUS AND
  8263	NUTRITIOUS, AND THE FAT PRESERVED, IF YOU ENVELOP THEM IN A DOUGH OF
  8264	FLOUR AND OIL AND BAKE THEM IN THE OVEN [3].
  8265	
  8266	    [1] Probably game birds in an advanced stage of "_haut
  8267	    goût_" (as the Germans use the antiquated French term),
  8268	    or "_mortification_" as the French cook says. Possibly
  8269	    also such birds as crows, black birds, buzzards, etc.,
  8270	    and fish-feeding fowl. Moreover, it must be borne in
  8271	    mind that the refrigeration facilities of the ancients
  8272	    were not too good and that fresh goods spoiled quickly.
  8273	    Hence, perhaps, excessive seasoning, at least, as
  8274	    compared to our modern methods.
  8275	
  8276	    List. _aves piscivoras_; Hum. thinks the birds to be
  8277	    downright spoiled: _olidas, rancidas, & grave olentes_.
  8278	
  8279	    [2] Tor. Sentence wanting in other texts.
  8280	
  8281	    [3] For birds with a goatish smell Apicius should have
  8282	    repeated his excellent formula in ℞ No. 212, the
  8283	    method of parboiling the birds before final coction, if,
  8284	    indeed, one cannot dispense with such birds altogether.
  8285	    The above recipe does not in the least indicate how to
  8286	    treat smelly birds. Wrapping them in dough would vastly
  8287	    increase the ill-savour.
  8288	
  8289	    As for game birds, we agree with most connoisseurs that
  8290	    they should have just a suspicion of "_haut goût_"--a
  8291	    condition of advanced mellowness after the _rigor
  8292	    mortis_ has disappeared.

  8426	    [1] Lister is of the opinion that the _pullus Parthicus_

  8508	
  8509	    A most incomplete formula. It does not state whether the
  8510	    ingredients are to be added to the sauce or the
  8511	    dressing. We have an idea that the chicken is pickled in
  8512	    this solution before roasting and that the pickle is
  8513	    used in making the gravy.

  8537	    [1] G.-V. _Perfundes_; Tor. _piper fundes_.
  8538	
  8539	    The pumpkin, not mentioned here, is likewise served cold
  8540	    boiled, seasoned with the same dressing. It is perhaps
  8541	    used for stuffing the chicken and cooked simultaneously
  8542	    with the same.
  8543	
  8544	
  8545	[244] CHICKEN AND DASHEENS [1]
  8546	    _PULLUM ELIXUM CUM COLOCASIIS ELIXIS_
  8547	
  8548	THE ABOVE SAUCE IS ALSO USED FOR THIS DISH. STUFF THE CHICKEN WITH
  8549	[peeled] DASHEENS AND [stoned] GREEN OLIVES, THOUGH NOT TOO MUCH SO
  8550	THAT THE DRESSING MAY HAVE ROOM FOR EXPANSION, TO PREVENT BURSTING
  8551	WHILE THE CHICKEN IS BEING COOKED IN THE POT. HOLD IT DOWN WITH A
  8552	SMALL BASKET, LIFT IT UP FREQUENTLY [2] AND HANDLE CAREFULLY SO THAT
  8553	THE CHICKEN DOES NOT BURST [3].
  8554	
  8555	    [1] Dasheens are the equivalent of the ancient
  8556	    colocasium; at least they are very close relatives. Cf.
  8557	    Notes to ℞ Nos. 74, 216, 244, 322.
  8558	
  8559	    [2] For inspection. G.-V. _levas_; Tor. _lavabis_, for
  8560	    which there is no reason.
  8561	
  8562	    [3] Dann. and Goll., not knowing the colocasium or
  8563	    dasheen have entirely erroneous versions of this
  8564	    formula. The dasheen is well adapted for the stuffing of
  8565	    fowl. Ordinarily the dasheen is boiled or steamed,
  8566	    mashed, seasoned and then stuffed inside of a raw
  8567	    chicken which is then roasted. Being very starchy, the
  8568	    dasheen readily absorbs the fats and juices of the
  8569	    roast, making a delicious dressing, akin in taste to a
  8570	    combined potato and chestnut purée.
  8571	
  8572	    As the above chicken is cooked in _bouillon_ or water,
  8573	    the dasheen may be used in a raw state for filling. We
  8574	    have tried this method. Instead of confining the chicken
  8575	    in a basket, we have tied it in a napkin and boiled
  8576	    slowly until done. Serve cold, with the above dressing.

  8579	[245] CHICKEN À LA VARUS [1]
  8580	    _PULLUS VARDANUS_
  8581	
  8582	COOK THE CHICKEN IN THIS STOCK: BROTH, OIL, WINE, A BUNCH OF LEEKS,
  8583	CORIANDER, SATURY; WHEN DONE, CRUSH PEPPER, NUTS WITH 2 GLASSES OF
  8584	WATER [2] AND THE JUICE OF THE CHICKEN. RETIRE THE BUNCHES OF GREENS,
  8585	ADD MILK TO TASTE. THE THINGS CRUSHED IN THE MORTAR ADD TO THE CHICKEN
  8586	AND COOK IT TOGETHER: THICKEN THE SAUCE WITH BEATEN WHITES OF EGG [3]
  8587	AND POUR THE SAUCE OVER THE CHICKEN. THIS IS CALLED "WHITE SAUCE."
  8588	
  8589	    [1] G.-V. _Vardanus_; Tor. _Vardamus_; Hum. _Vardanus
  8590	    legendum, puto, Varianus, portentuosæ luxuriæ
  8591	    Imperator_. Hum. thinks the dish is dedicated to emperor
  8592	    Varianus (?) The word may also be the adjective of
  8593	    Varus, Quintilius V., commander of colonial armies and
  8594	    glutton, under Augustus. Varus committed suicide after
  8595	    his defeat in the Teutoburg Forest by the Germans.
  8596	
  8597	    [2] G.-V. broth, own stock--_ius de suo sibi_.
  8598	
  8599	    [3] Strain, avoid ebullition after the eggs have been
  8600	    added. Most unusual _liaison_; usually the yolks are
  8601	    used for this purpose. The whites are consistent with
  8602	    the name of the sauce.
  8603	
  8604	
  8605	[246] CHICKEN À LA FRONTO [1]
  8606	    _PULLUM FRONTONIANUM_
  8607	
  8608	A HALF-COOKED CHICKEN MARINADED IN A PICKLE OF BROTH, MIXED WITH OIL,
  8609	TO WHICH IS ADDED A BUNCH OF DILL, LEEKS, SATURY AND GREEN CORIANDER.
  8610	FINISH IT IN THIS BROTH. WHEN DONE, TAKE THE CHICKEN OUT [2] DRESS IT
  8611	NICELY ON A DISH, POUR OVER THE [sauce, colored with] REDUCED MUST,
  8612	SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.
  8613	
  8614	    [1] Named for a Roman by the name of Fronto. There is a
  8615	    sucking pig à la Fronto, too. Cf. ℞ No. 374. M.
  8616	    Cornelius Fronto was orator and author during the reign
  8617	    of Emperor Hadrian. According to Dann. a certain
  8618	    Frontone under Emperor Severus.
  8619	
  8620	    [2] List., G.-V. _levabis_; Tor. _lavabis_, for which

  8625	[247] CREAMED CHICKEN WITH PASTE [1]
  8626	    _PULLUS TRACTOGALATUS_ [2]
  8627	
  8628	COOK THE CHICKEN [as follows, in] BROTH, OIL, WITH WINE ADDED, TO
  8629	WHICH ADD A BUNCH OF CORIANDER AND [green] ONIONS. WHEN DONE TAKE IT
  8630	OUT [3] [strain and save] THE BROTH, AND PUT IT IN A NEW SAUCE PAN,
  8631	ADD MILK AND A LITTLE SALT, HONEY AND A PINT [4] OF WATER, THAT IS, A
  8632	THIRD PART: PLACE IT BACK ON A SLOW FIRE TO SIMMER. FINALLY BREAK [the
  8633	paste, [1]] PUT IT LITTLE BY LITTLE INTO [the boiling broth] STIRRING
  8634	WELL SO IT WILL NOT BURN. PUT THE CHICKEN IN, EITHER WHOLE OR IN
  8635	PIECES [5] DISH IT OUT IN A DEEP DISH. THIS COVER WITH THE FOLLOWING
  8636	SAUCE [6] PEPPER, LOVAGE, ORIGANY, MOISTENED WITH HONEY AND A LITTLE
  8637	REDUCED MUST. ADD SOME OF THE [chicken] BROTH, HEAT IN A SMALL SAUCE
  8638	PAN AND WHEN IT BOILS THICKEN WITH ROUX [7] AND SERVE.
  8639	
  8640	    [1] Spätzle, noodles, macaroni; this dish is the ancient
  8641	    "Chicken Tetrazzini." Dann. Chicken pie or patty.
  8642	
  8643	    [2] _tractum_ and _gala_, prepared with paste and milk.
  8644	    Cf. _tractomelitus_, from _tractum_ and _meli_, paste
  8645	    and honey.
  8646	
  8647	    [3] Cf. Note 2 to ℞ Nos. 244 and 246.
  8648	
  8649	    [4] List. _minimum_; Tor. _heminam_; Sch. _eminam_. See
  8650	    Measures. The noodle paste should be cooked separately
  8651	    in the water.
  8652	
  8653	    [5] List. _vel carptum_, which is correct. Tor. _vel
  8654	    careotam_, out of place here.
  8655	
  8656	    [6] This sauce seems to be superfluous. Very likely it
  8657	    is a separate formula for a sauce of some kind.
  8658	
  8659	    [7] Seems superfluous, too. The noodle paste in the
  8660	    chicken gravy makes it sufficiently thick.
  8661	
  8662	
  8663	[248] STUFFED CHICKEN [OR PIG]
  8664	    _PULLUS FARSILIS_ [1]
  8665	
  8666	EMPTY THE CHICKEN THROUGH THE APERTURE OF THE NECK SO THAT NONE OF THE
  8667	ENTRAILS REMAIN. CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, GINGER, CUT MEAT [2] COOKED
  8668	SPELT, BESIDES CRUSH BRAINS COOKED IN THE [chicken] BROTH, BREAK EGGS
  8669	AND MIX ALL TOGETHER IN ORDER TO MAKE A SOLID DRESSING; ADD BROTH TO
  8670	TASTE AND A LITTLE OIL, WHOLE PEPPER, PLENTY OF NUTS. WITH THIS
  8671	DRESSING STUFF EITHER A CHICKEN OR A SUCKLING PIG, LEAVING ENOUGH ROOM
  8672	FOR EXPANSION [3].
  8673	
  8674	    [1] Tor. _fusilis_.
  8675	
  8676	    [2] Preferably raw pork or veal.
  8677	
  8678	    [3] A most sumptuous dressing; it compares favorably
  8679	    with our popular stale bread pap usually called "chicken
  8680	    dressing."
  8681	
  8682	
  8683	[249] STUFFED CAPON LIKEWISE
  8684	    _SIMILITER IN CAPO FACIES_ [1]
  8685	
  8686	THE CAPON IS STUFFED IN A SIMILAR WAY BUT IS COOKED WITH ALL THE BONES
  8687	REMOVED [2].
  8688	
  8689	    [1] Sch. _in capso_. May be interpreted thus: Cooked in
  8690	    an envelope of caul or linen, in which case it would
  8691	    correspond to our modern galantine of chicken.
  8692	
  8693	    [2] Tor. _ossibus eiectis_; Hum. _omnibus e._; i.e. all
  8694	    the entrails, etc., which is not correct. The bones must
  8695	    be removed from the capon in this case.
  8696	
  8697	
  8698	[250] CHICKEN AND CREAM SAUCE [1]
  8699	    _PULLUS LEUCOZOMUS_ [2]
  8700	
  8701	TAKE A CHICKEN AND PREPARE IT AS ABOVE. EMPTY IT THROUGH THE APERTURE
  8702	OF THE NECK SO THAT NONE OF THE ENTRAILS REMAIN. TAKE [a little] WATER
  8703	[3] AND PLENTY OF SPANISH OIL, STIR, COOK TOGETHER UNTIL ALL MOISTURE
  8704	IS EVAPORATED [4] WHEN THIS IS DONE TAKE THE CHICKEN OUT, SO THAT THE
  8705	GREATEST POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF OIL REMAINS BEHIND [5] SPRINKLE WITH
  8706	PEPPER AND SERVE [6].
  8707	
  8708	    [1] The ancient version of Chicken à la Maryland, Wiener
  8709	    Backhähndl, etc.
  8710	
  8711	    [2] Tor. _Leocozymus_; from the Greek _leucozomos_,
  8712	    prepared with white sauce. The formula for the cream
  8713	    sauce is lacking here. Cf. ℞ No. 245.
  8714	
  8715	    [3] The use of water to clarify the oil which is to
  8716	    serve as a deep frying fat is an ingenious idea, little
  8717	    practised today. It surely saves the fat or oil,
  8718	    prevents premature burning or blackening by frequent
  8719	    use, and gives a better tasting _friture_. The above
  8720	    recipe is a mere fragment, but even this reveals the
  8721	    extraordinary knowledge of culinary principles of
  8722	    Apicius who reveals himself to us as a master of
  8723	    well-understood principles of good cookery that are so
  8724	    often ignored today. Cf. Note 5 to ℞ No. 497.
  8725	
  8726	    [4] The recipe fails to state that the chicken must be
  8727	    breaded, or that the pieces of chicken be turned in
  8728	    flour, etc., and fried in the oil.
  8729	
  8730	    [5] Another vital rule of deep fat frying not stated, or
  8731	    rather stated in the language of the kitchen, namely
  8732	    that the chicken must be crisp, dry, that is, not
  8733	    saturated with oil, which of course every good fry cook
  8734	    knows.
  8735	
  8736	    [6] With the cream sauce, prepared separately, spread on
  8737	    the platter, with the fried chicken inside, or the sauce
  8738	    in a separate dish, we have here a very close
  8739	    resemblance to a very popular modern dish.

  8954	    and then suddenly given all the mead they wanted to
  8955	    drink. The violent expansion of the figs in the
  8956	    stomachs, or the fermentation caused acute indigestion
  8957	    which killed the pigs. The livers were very much
  8958	    enlarged, similar to the cramming of geese for the sake
  8959	    of obtaining abnormally large livers. This latter method

  9344	[285] PIG'S PAUNCH
  9345	    _VENTREM PORCINUM_
  9346	
  9347	CLEAN THE PAUNCH OF A SUCKLING PIG WELL WITH SALT AND VINEGAR AND
  9348	PRESENTLY WASH WITH WATER. THEN FILL IT WITH THE FOLLOWING DRESSING:
  9349	PIECES OF PORK POUNDED IN THE MORTAR, THREE BRAINS--THE NERVES
  9350	REMOVED--MIX WITH RAW EGGS, ADD NUTS, WHOLE PEPPER, AND SAUCE TO
  9351	TASTE. CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, SILPHIUM, ANISE, GINGER, A LITTLE RUE;
  9352	FILL THE PAUNCH WITH IT, NOT TOO MUCH, THOUGH, LEAVING PLENTY OF ROOM
  9353	FOR EXPANSION LEST IT BURSTS WHILE BEING COOKED. PUT IT IN A POT WITH
  9354	BOILING WATER, RETIRE AND PRICK WITH A NEEDLE SO THAT IT DOES NOT
  9355	BURST. WHEN HALF DONE, TAKE IT OUT AND HANG IT INTO THE SMOKE TO TAKE
  9356	ON COLOR; NOW BOIL IT OVER AGAIN AND FINISH IT LEISURELY. NEXT TAKE
  9357	THE BROTH, SOME PURE WINE AND A LITTLE OIL, OPEN THE PAUNCH WITH A
  9358	SMALL KNIFE. SPRINKLE WITH THE BROTH AND LOVAGE; PLACE THE PIG NEAR
  9359	THE FIRE TO HEAT IT, TURN IT AROUND IN BRAN [or bread crumbs] IMMERSE
  9360	IN [sprinkle with] BRINE AND FINISH [the outer crust to a golden
  9361	brown] [1].
  9362	
  9363	    [1] The good old English way of finishing a roast joint
  9364	    called dredging.
  9365	
  9366	    Lister has this formula divided into two; Danneil and Schuch
  9367	    make three different formulas out of it.

  9380	SPLIT THEM INTO TWO PARTS SO THAT THEY ARE SPREAD OUT [1] SPRINKLE THE
  9381	OPENING WITH CRUSHED PEPPER AND [ditto] NUTS, FINELY CHOPPED CORIANDER
  9382	AND CRUSHED FENNEL SEED. THE TENDERLOINS ARE THEN ROLLED UP TO BE
  9383	ROASTED; TIE TOGETHER, WRAP IN CAUL, PARBOIL IN OIL [2] AND BROTH, AND
  9384	THEN ROAST IN THE OVEN OR BROIL ON THE GRIDIRON.
  9385	
  9386	    [1] "Frenched," the meat here being pork tenderloin.
  9387	
  9388	    [2] G.-V. best broth and a little oil, which is more
  9389	    acceptable.

  9395	HAM
  9396	  _PERNA_
  9397	
  9398	
  9399	[287] [Baked Picnic] HAM [Pork Shoulder, fresh or cured]
  9400	    _PERNAM_
  9401	
  9402	THE HAM SHOULD BE BRAISED WITH A GOOD NUMBER OF FIGS AND SOME THREE
  9403	LAUREL LEAVES; THE SKIN IS THEN PULLED OFF AND CUT INTO SQUARE PIECES;
  9404	THESE ARE MACERATED WITH HONEY. THEREUPON MAKE DOUGH CRUMBS OF FLOUR
  9405	AND OIL [1] LAY THE DOUGH OVER OR AROUND THE HAM, STUD THE TOP WITH
  9406	THE PIECES OF THE SKIN SO THAT THEY WILL BE BAKED WITH THE DOUGH [bake
  9407	slowly] AND WHEN DONE, RETIRE FROM THE OVEN AND SERVE [2].
  9408	
  9409	    [1] Ordinary pie or pastry dough, or perhaps a
  9410	    preparation similar to streusel, unsweetened.
  9411	
  9412	    [2] Experimenting with this formula, we have adhered to
  9413	    the instructions as closely as possible, using regular
  9414	    pie dough to envelop the parboiled meat. The figs were
  9415	    retired from the sauce pan long before the meat was done
  9416	    and they were served around the ham as a garnish. As a
  9417	    consequence we partook of a grand dish that no inmate of
  9418	    Olympus would have sneezed at.
  9419	
  9420	    In Pompeii an inn-keeper had written the following on
  9421	    the wall of his establishment: _Ubi perna cocta est si
  9422	    convivæ apponitur non gustat pernam linguit ollam aut
  9423	    caccabum._
  9424	
  9425	    When we first beheld this message we took the inn-keeper
  9426	    for a humorist and clever advertiser; but now we are
  9427	    convinced that he was in earnest when he said that his
  9428	    guests would lick the sauce pan in which his hams were
  9429	    cooked.
  9430	
  9431	
  9432	[288] TO COOK PORK SHOULDER
  9433	    _PERNÆ _[1]_ COCTURAM_
  9434	
  9435	HAM SIMPLY COOKED IN WATER WITH FIGS IS USUALLY DRESSED ON A PLATTER
  9436	[baking pan] SPRINKLED WITH CRUMBS AND REDUCED WINE, OR, STILL BETTER,
  9437	WITH SPICED WINE [and is glazed under the open flame, or with a shovel
  9438	containing red-hot embers].
  9439	
  9440	    [1] _Perna_ is usually applied to shoulder of pork,
  9441	    fresh, also cured.
  9442	
  9443	    _Coxa_ is the hind leg, or haunch of pork, or fresh ham.
  9444	    Cf. note 1 to ℞ No. 289.

  9451	[289] FRESH HAM
  9452	    _MUSTEIS _[1]_ PETASONEM_ [2]
  9453	
  9454	A FRESH HAM IS COOKED WITH 2 POUNDS OF BARLEY AND 25 FIGS. WHEN DONE
  9455	SKIN, GLAZE THE SURFACE WITH A FIRE SHOVEL FULL OF GLOWING COALS,
  9456	SPREAD HONEY OVER IT, OR, WHAT'S BETTER: PUT IT IN THE OVEN COVERED
  9457	WITH HONEY. WHEN IT HAS A NICE COLOR, PUT IN A SAUCE PAN RAISIN WINE,
  9458	PEPPER, A BUNCH OF RUE AND PURE WINE TO TASTE. WHEN THIS [sauce] IS
  9459	DONE, POUR HALF OF IT OVER THE HAM AND IN THE OTHER HALF SOAK
  9460	SPECIALLY MADE GINGER BREAD [3] THE REMNANT OF THE SAUCE AFTER MOST OF
  9461	IT IS THOROUGHLY SOAKED INTO THE BREAD, ADD TO THE HAM [4].
  9462	
  9463	    [1] _Musteus_, fresh, young, new; _vinum mustum_, new
  9464	    wine, must. Properly perhaps, _Petasonem ex mustaceis_;
  9465	    cf. note 3.
  9466	
  9467	    [2] Hum. _verum petaso coxa cum crure_ [shank] _esse
  9468	    dicitur...._
  9469	
  9470	    Plainly, we are dealing here with fresh, uncured ham.
  9471	
  9472	    [3] A certain biscuit or cake made of must, spices and
  9473	    pepper, perhaps baked on laurel leaves. _Mustaceus_ was
  9474	    a kind of cake, the flour of which had been kneaded with
  9475	    must, cheese, anise, etc., the cake was baked upon
  9476	    laurel leaves.
  9477	
  9478	    [4] Tor. continues without interruption. He has the
  9479	    three foregoing formulæ thrown into one.

  9490	OIL AND A TRIFLE OF SALT.
  9491	
  9492	    [1] Lister, at this point, has forgotten his explanation
  9493	    of _laridum_, and now accepts the word in its proper
  9494	    sense. This rather belated correction by Lister
  9495	    confirms the correctness of our own earlier
  9496	    observations. Cf. note to ℞ Nos. 41 and 148.

  9524	
  9525	    [2] Lungs of slaughtered animals are little used
  9526	    nowadays. The soaking of livers in milk is quite common;
  9527	    it removes the offensive taste of the gall.

  9548	HOME-MADE SWEET DISHES AND HONEY SWEET-MEATS

  9550	
  9551	
  9552	[294] HOME-MADE SWEETS
  9553	    _DULCIA DOMESTICA_
  9554	
  9555	LITTLE HOME CONFECTIONS (WHICH ARE CALLED DULCIARIA) ARE MADE THUS:
  9556	[2] LITTLE PALMS OR (AS THEY ARE ORDINARILY CALLED) [3] DATES ARE
  9557	STUFFED--AFTER THE SEEDS HAVE BEEN REMOVED--WITH A NUT OR WITH NUTS
  9558	AND GROUND PEPPER, SPRINKLED WITH SALT ON THE OUTSIDE AND ARE CANDIED
  9559	IN HONEY AND SERVED [4].
  9560	
  9561	    [1] _Dulcia_, sweetmeats, cakes; hence _dulciarius_, a
  9562	    pastry cook or confectioner.
  9563	
  9564	    The fact that here attention is drawn to home-made sweet
  9565	    dishes may clear up the absence of regular baking and
  9566	    dessert formulæ in Apicius. The trade of the
  9567	    _dulciarius_ was so highly developed at that time that
  9568	    the professional bakers and confectioners supplied the
  9569	    entire home market with their wares, making it
  9570	    convenient and unprofitable for the domestic cook to
  9571	    compete with their organized business, a condition which
  9572	    largely exists in our modern highly civilized centers of
  9573	    population today. Cf. "Cooks."

  9580	[295] ANOTHER SWEETMEAT
  9581	    _ALITER DULCIA_
  9582	
  9583	GRATE [scrape, peel] SOME VERY BEST FRESH APHROS [1] AND IMMERSE IN
  9584	MILK. WHEN SATURATED PLACE IN THE OVEN TO HEAT BUT NOT TO DRY OUT;
  9585	WHEN THOROUGHLY HOT RETIRE FROM OVEN, POUR OVER SOME HONEY, STIPPLE
  9586	[the fruit] SO THAT THE HONEY MAY PENETRATE, SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER [2]
  9587	AND SERVE.
  9588	
  9589	    [1] Tor., Tac., Lan. _musteos aphros_; Vat. Ms., G.-V.
  9590	    _afros_; List. _apios_, i.e. celery, which is farthest
  9591	    from the mark. Goll. interprets this a "cider apple,"
  9592	    reminiscent, probably, of _musteos_, which is fresh,
  9593	    new, young, and which has here nothing to do with cider.
  9594	
  9595	    _Aphros_ is not identified. Perhaps the term stood for
  9596	    Apricots (Old English: Aphricocks) or some other African
  9597	    fruit or plant; Lister's celery is to be rejected on
  9598	    gastronomical grounds.
  9599	
  9600	    The above treatment would correspond to that which is
  9601	    given apricots and peaches today. They are peeled,
  9602	    immersed in cream and sweetened with sugar. Apicius'
  9603	    heating of the fruit in milk is new to us; it sounds
  9604	    good, for it has a tendency to parboil any hard fruit,
  9605	    make it more digestible and reduce the fluid to a creamy
  9606	    consistency.
  9607	
  9608	    [2] The "pepper" again, as pointed out in several other
  9609	    places, here is some spice of agreeable taste as are
  9610	    used in desserts today.

  9656	SMALL COOKIES. FRY THESE IN THE BEST OIL, TAKE THEM OUT, DIP INTO
  9657	[hot] HONEY, SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER [2] AND SERVE.
  9658	
  9659	    [1] This confirms the assumption that some flour or meal
  9660	    is used in ℞ No. 298 also without which this present
  9661	    preparation would not "stand up."
  9662	
  9663	    [2] It is freely admitted that the word "pepper" not
  9664	    always stands for the spice that we know by this name.

  9689	    far-fetched conclusion, although standard dictionaries
  9690	    say that the _tyropatina_ is a kind of cheese cake. It
  9691	    must be borne in mind, however, that the ancient
  9692	    definition of "custard" is "egg cheese," probably
  9693	    because of the similarity in appearance and texture.

  9789	    This favorite superstition of the ancients leads many
  9790	    writers, as might be expected, into fanciful
  9791	    speculations. Humelberg, quoting Martial, says: _Veneram

  9793	    XIII, Ep. 34:

  9797	
  9798	    We fail to find this quotation from Varro in his works,
  9799	    M. Teren. Varronis De Re Rustica, Lugduni, 1541, but we
  9800	    read in Columella and Pliny that the buds or shoots of
  9801	    reeds were called by some "bulbs," by others "eyes,"
  9802	    and, remembering that these shoots make very desirable
  9803	    vegetables when properly cooked, we feel inclined to
  9804	    include these among the term "bulbs." Platina also adds
  9805	    the squill or sea onion to this category. Nonnus, p. 84,
  9806	    Diæteticon, Antwerp, 1645, quotes Columella as saying:

  9975	"EGYPTIAN BEAN") USE [2] PEPPER, CUMIN, RUE, HONEY, OR BROTH, AND A
  9976	LITTLE OIL; WHEN DONE BIND WITH ROUX [3] COLOCASIUM IS THE ROOT OF THE
  9977	EGYPTIAN BEAN WHICH IS USED EXCLUSIVELY [4].
  9978	
  9979	    [1] Cf. notes to ℞ Nos. 74, 172, 216, 244; also the
  9980	    copious explanations by Humelberg, fol. III.
  9981	
  9982	    [2] Tor. who is trying hard to explain the _colocasium_.
  9983	    His name, "Egyptian Bean" may be due to the mealiness
  9984	    and bean-like texture of the _colocasium_ tuber;
  9985	    otherwise there is no resemblance to a bean, except,
  9986	    perhaps, the seed pod which is not used for food. This
  9987	    simile has led other commentators to believe that the
  9988	    _colocasium_ in reality was a bean.
  9989	
  9990	    The U.S. Department of Agriculture has in recent years
  9991	    imported various specimens of that taro species
  9992	    (belonging to the _colocasia_), and the plants are now
  9993	    successfully being farmed in the southern parts of the
  9994	    United States, with fair prospects of becoming an
  9995	    important article of daily diet. The Department has
  9996	    favored us repeatedly with samples of the taro, or
  9997	    dasheen, (_Colocasium Antiquorum_) and we have made many
  9998	    different experiments with this agreeable, delightful
  9999	    and important "new" vegetable. It can be prepared in
 10000	    every way like a potato, and possesses advantages over
 10001	    the potato as far as value of nutrition, flavor, culture
 10002	    and keeping qualities are concerned. As a commercial
 10003	    article, it is not any more expensive than any good kind
 10004	    of potato. It grows where the potato will not thrive,
 10005	    and vice versa. It thus saves much in freight to parts
 10006	    where the potato does not grow.
 10007	
 10008	    The ancient _colocasium_ is no doubt a close relative of
 10009	    the modern dasheen or taro. The Apician _colocasium_ was
 10010	    perhaps very similar to the ordinary Elephant-Ear,
 10011	    _colocasium Antiquorum Schott_, often called _caladium
 10012	    esculentum_, or _tanyah_, more recently called the
 10013	    "Dasheen" which is a corruption of the French "de
 10014	    Chine"--from China--indicating the supposed origin of
 10015	    this variety of taro. The dasheen is a broad-leaved
 10016	    member of the _arum_ family. The name dasheen originated
 10017	    in the West Indies whence it was imported into the
 10018	    United States around 1910, and the name is now
 10019	    officially adopted.
 10020	
 10021	    Mark Catesby, in his Natural History of Carolina,
 10022	    Florida and the Bahama Islands, London, 1781, describes
 10023	    briefly under the name of _arum maximum Aegypticum_ a
 10024	    plant which was doubtless one of the tanyahs or taros.
 10025	    He says: "This was a welcome improvement among the
 10026	    negroes and was esteemed a blessing; they being
 10027	    delighted with all their African food, particularly
 10028	    this, which a great part of Africa subsists much on."
 10029	
 10030	    Torinus, groping for the right name, calls it variously
 10031	    _colosium_, _coledium_, _coloesium_, till he finally
 10032	    gets it right, _colocasium_.
 10033	
 10034	    [3] The root or tubers of this plant was used by the
 10035	    ancients as a vegetable. They probably boiled and then
 10036	    peeled and sliced the tubers, seasoning the pieces with
 10037	    the above ingredients, heated them in bouillon stock and
 10038	    thickened the gravy in the usual way. Since the tuber is
 10039	    very starchy, little roux is required for binding.

 10068	    with having popularized the snail in Rome a little
 10069	    before the civil wars between Cæsar and Pompey. If we
 10070	    could believe Varro, snails grew to enormous
 10071	    proportions. A supper of the younger Pliny consisted of

 10439	
 10440	    [1] G.-V., List. _in ovi fero_; Dann. "wild eggs," i.e.,
 10441	    the eggs of game birds, and he comes to the conclusion
 10442	    that game birds themselves are meant to be used in this
 10443	    formula, as no reference to "eggs" is made.
 10444	
 10445	    There can be no doubt but what this formula deals with
 10446	    the preparation of sheep; Torinus says expressly:
 10447	    _oviferum, hoc est, carnem ovis sylvestris_--the meat of
 10448	    sheep from the woods, mountain sheep. _Ferum_ is "wild,"
 10449	    "game," but it also means "pregnant." For this double
 10450	    sense the formula may be interpreted as dealing with
 10451	    either wild sheep, or with pregnant sheep, or, more
 10452	    probably, with unborn baby lamb, which in antiquity as
 10453	    today is often killed principally for its skin.
 10454	
 10455	    [2] Tor.
 10456	
 10457	    [3] Mint is still associated with lamb; the above sauce
 10458	    appears to be merely an elaborate Roman ancestor of our
 10459	    modern mint sauce, served with lamb, the chief
 10460	    ingredients of which are mint, vinegar and sugar, served

 10567	    [1] It appears that the binding should be done before
 10568	    the stew is dished out; but this sentence illustrates
 10569	    the consummate art of Apicius. The good cook carefully
 10570	    separates the meat (as it is cooked) from the sauce,
 10571	    eliminates impurities, binds and strains it and puts the
 10572	    meat back into the finished sauce. This is the ideal way
 10573	    of making a stew which evidently was known to Apicius.

 10953	    whether it was possible to make a will. This granted, he
 10954	    calls out with a loud voice to his parents to save for
 10955	    them the food that was to have been his own in the
 10956	    future, to wit:

 10964	    cannot attend, I give and bequeath: thirty measures of
 10965	    barley; and of my nobler parts and property I give and
 10966	    bequeath, to the cobbler: my bristles; to the brawlers,
 10967	    my jaw-bones; to the deaf, my ears; to the shyster
 10968	    lawyers, my tongue; to the cow-herds, my intestines; to

 10973	    hoofs; and to the cook--though not to be named--I give
 10974	    and bequeath and transmit my belly and appendage which I
 10975	    have dragged with me from the rotten oak bottoms to the

 11036	    [1] Tor. _Hortulanus_; Gardener's style, the French
 11037	    equivalent _Jardinière_, a very common name for all
 11038	    dishes containing young vegetables. However, in the
 11039	    above rich formula there is very little to remind us of
 11040	    the gardener's style, excepting the last part of the
 11041	    formula, enumerating a number of fresh vegetables. It is
 11042	    unthinkable for any gourmet to incorporate these with
 11043	    the rich dressing. The vegetables should be used as a
 11044	    garnish for the finished roast. This leads us to believe
 11045	    that the above is really two distinct formulæ, or that
 11046	    the vegetables were intended for garniture.
 11047	
 11048	    [2] This extraordinary and rich dressing, perfectly
 11049	    feasible and admirable when compared with our own
 11050	    "Toulouse," "Financière," "Chipolata," can be palatable
 11051	    only when each component part is cooked separately
 11052	    before being put into the pig. The eggs must be whipped
 11053	    and diluted with broth and poured over the filling to
 11054	    serve as binder. The pig must be parboiled before
 11055	    filling, and the final cooking or roasting must be done
 11056	    very slowly and carefully--procedure not stated by the
 11057	    original which it takes for granted.

 11164	IS MADE WITH RUE, PLENTY OF PEPPER, ONION, SATURY, DATES, BROTH,
 11165	REDUCED WINE, OR SPICED WINE. THIS IS REDUCED TO THE PROPER
 11166	CONSISTENCY AND IS LAID UNDER; BUT THE HARE REMAINS IN THE BROTH
 11167	FLAVORED WITH LASER.
 11168	
 11169	    [1] Reminding of the popular meat loaf, made of
 11170	    remnants: _Falscher Hase_, "Imitation Hare," as it is
 11171	    known on the Continent.
 11172	
 11173	    The ancients probably used the trimmings of hare and
 11174	    other meat for this forcemeat, or meat loaf, either to
 11175	    stuff the hare with, or to make a meal of the
 11176	    preparation itself, as indicated above.
 11177	
 11178	    We also recall that the ancients had ingenious baking
 11179	    moulds of metal in the shape of hares and other animals.
 11180	    These moulds, no doubt, were used for baking or the
 11181	    serving of preparations of this sort. The absence of
 11182	    table forks and cutlery as is used today made such
 11183	    preparations very appropriate and convenient in
 11184	    leisurely dining.

 11195	
 11196	    [1] Fagots, or whips made of different herbs and brushes
 11197	    are often employed by Apicius, a very subtle device to
 11198	    impart faint flavors to sauces. The custom has been in
 11199	    use for ages. With the return of mixed drinks in America
 11200	    it was revived by the use of cinnamon sticks with which
 11201	    to stir the drinks.

 11255	    getting ready for braising.

 11271	
 11272	    [2] To bone the carcass, it usually is opened in the
 11273	    back, flattened out and all the bones are easily
 11274	    removed. In that state it is easily pickled and
 11275	    thoroughly smoked.

 11279	    reading, "in the smoke," assuming that _furnum_ is a
 11280	    typographical error in Lan. and his successors, Tac. and
 11281	    Tor. Still, roasts have for ages been "hung on chains
 11282	    close to or above the open fire"; Torinus may not be
 11283	    wrong, after all, in this essential direction. However,
 11284	    a boned and flattened-out hare would be better broiled
 11285	    on the grill than hung up over the open fire.

 11322	    forcemeat inside, the outside covered with caul or
 11323	    paper, fastened with skewers. Danneil's interpretation
 11324	    suggests the thought that the raw hare's meat is cut
 11325	    into squares which are filled with forcemeat, rolled,
 11326	    wrapped, and roast--a roulade of hare in the regular
 11327	    term.

 11399	    [1] _Glis_, dormouse, a special favorite of the
 11400	    ancients, has nothing to do with mice. The fat dormouse
 11401	    of the South of Europe is the size of a rat, arboreal
 11402	    rodent, living in trees.
 11403	
 11404	    Galen, III, de Alim.; Plinius, VIII, 57/82; Varro, III,
 11405	    describing the _glirarium_, place where the dormouse was
 11406	    raised for the table.
 11407	
 11408	    Petronius, Cap. 31, describes another way of preparing
 11409	    dormouse. Nonnus, Diæteticon, p. 194/5, says that
 11410	    Fluvius Hirpinus was the first man to raise dormouse in
 11411	    the _glirarium_.
 11412	
 11413	    Dormouse, as an article of diet, should not astonish
 11414	    Americans who relish squirrel, opossum, muskrat, "coon,"
 11415	    etc.

 11941	    included in the above chapter XI, as does Tor. All of
 11942	    the above fish were salt, and probably were important
 11943	    commercial articles. The _silurus_, for instance, is
 11944	    best in the river Danube in the Balkans, while the red
 11945	    mullet, as seen in ℞ No. 427 came from the sea of

 11969	AND POUR OVER THE FISH WHICH IS EITHER FRIED OR BROILED, OMITTING SALT
 11970	[4].
 11971	
 11972	    [1] Tor. _mulo_, the red sur-mullet--a very esteemed
 11973	    fish.
 11974	
 11975	    [2] Tarichea, town of Galilee, on the sea of Galilee.
 11976	    Salt mullet as prepared at Tarichea was known as
 11977	    _Tarichus_. This became finally a generic name for all
 11978	    kinds of salt fish, whether coming from Tarichea or from
 11979	    elsewhere. We have an interesting analogy in "Finnan
 11980	    Haddie," smoked Haddock from Findon, Scotland, corrupted
 11981	    into "Finnan," and now used for any kind of smoked
 11982	    Haddock. Cf. ℞ Nos. 144, 149.
 11983	
 11984	    [3] Tor. Quite correctly, he questions the need of
 11985	    condiments for salt fish.
 11986	
 11987	    [4] List. uses this last sentence as the title for the
 11988	    next formula, implying that more salt be added to the
 11989	    salt fish; Tor. is explicit in saying that no salt be
 11990	    added which of course, is correct.

 12006	SPRINKLE WITH VIRGIN OIL [7].
 12007	
 12008	    [1] Tor.
 12009	
 12010	    [2] G.-V. plainly, a contradiction. The possible meaning
 12011	    may be, "Salt Fish, without salt pork" as salt fish is
 12012	    frequently served with bacon.
 12013	
 12014	    [3] Dann. Crush the liver, which is probably correct. A
 12015	    paste or forcemeat of the livers and fish were made.
 12016	
 12017	    [4] The addition of salt would be superfluous if the
 12018	    liver of salt meat is used, excepting if the liver of
 12019	    hare, etc., predominated.
 12020	
 12021	    [5] G.-V. or liver of kid, wanting in Tor.
 12022	
 12023	    [6] Such fish-shape moulds existed, made of bronze,
 12024	    artistically finished, same as we possess them today;
 12025	    such moulds were made in various styles and shapes. Cf.
 12026	    ℞ No. 384.
 12027	
 12028	    [7] This is an attempt to make a "fish" of livers, not
 12029	    so much with the intention to deceive as to utilize the
 12030	    livers in an attractive way. A very nutritious dish and
 12031	    a most ingenious device, requiring much skill.
 12032	
 12033	    This is another good example of Roman cookery, far from
 12034	    being extravagant as it is reputed to be, it is
 12035	    economical and clever, and shows ingenuity in the
 12036	    utilization of good things which are often discarded as
 12037	    worthless.

 12047	    [1] G.-V. _Alter vice salsi_.
 12048	
 12049	    [2] Tor. _& salibus imbue_; List. _& salsa redde_. There
 12050	    is no sense to Lister's version, nor can we accept G.-V.
 12051	    who have _et salari defundes_.

 12053	
 12054	[430] ANOTHER WAY
 12055	    _ALITER SALSUM IN _[1]_ SALSO_
 12056

 12058	QUANTITY OF PEPPER AND ONE PIECE OF PEELED GARLIC, MOISTEN WITH BROTH
 12059	AND MIX IN A LITTLE OIL. THIS WILL CORRECT AND BENEFIT A SOUR STOMACH
 12060	AND PROMOTE DIGESTION [2].
 12061	
 12062	    [1] Tor., G.-V. _sine_.
 12063	
 12064	    [2] The title has reference to salt fish or salt pork;

 12084	
 12085	    [2] Baiæ, a very popular seaside resort of the ancients
 12086	    located in the bay of Naples. The stew was named after

 12091	    Both terms, if used in connection with the shellfish are
 12092	    correct. Lister in several places confuses this term
 12093	    with _spongiolus_--mushroom. This instance is the final
 12094	    vindication of Torinus, whose correctness was maintained

 12220	    [1] This chapter principally deals with fish sauces.
 12221	    Apparently it is by a different author than Books
 12222	    I-VIII, which have many formulæ for fish. While we have
 12223	    no direct proof, we are inclined to believe that Book X
 12224	    is a Roman version of a Greek treatise on fish sauces, a
 12225	    monograph, of which there existed many, according to
 12226	    Athenæus, which specialized on the various departments
 12227	    of cookery.

 12262	
 12263	    [1] Remarkable culinary ingenuity, resembling in
 12264	    principle the North American Indian method of cooking
 12265	    whitefish wrapped in clay. Today we use flour and water
 12266	    made into a stiff paste to seal a pan hermetically if no
 12267	    "pressure cooker" is available.
 12268	
 12269	    This formula cannot be classified under "Sauce for
 12270	    Boiled Fish."

 12280	    [1] Another fair example of the incompleteness, on the
 12281	    one hand, of the directions, and of the superfluity, on
 12282	    the other hand, of words such as the initial and the
 12283	    closing words, which characterizes so many of the
 12284	    formulæ. This is characteristic of ever so many culinary
 12285	    authors of all ages, who, lacking literary training,
 12286	    assume that the reader is thoroughly versed with the
 12287	    methods indicated. A versatile modern author would have
 12288	    said: "Poach the filleted fish in small water seasoned
 12289	    with coriander seed and green dill; sprinkle with
 12290	    vinegar before serving." He mentioned neither the salt
 12291	    nor the oil which he undoubtedly used.

 12418	
 12419	    [3] The laconic style in which all these fish
 12420	    preparations are given, is very confusing to the
 12421	    uninitiated. We assume that most of these ingredients
 12422	    were used to season the water in which to boil fish; or,
 12423	    to make a _court-bouillon_, a fish-essence of the bones
 12424	    and the trimmings of the fish, in which to poach the
 12425	    sliced fish. The liquor thus gained was reduced and in
 12426	    the moment of serving was bound with roux or with yolks,
 12427	    and the fish was masked with this sauce. The exceptions
 12428	    from this rule are, of course, in cases where the fish
 12429	    was broiled or fried.

 12643	    [1] Tor. sentence wanting in other texts.
 12644	
 12645	    [2] Note the position of lovage in this formula. Usually
 12646	    it follows pepper. We have finally accounted for this
 12647	    peculiarity. Torinus, throughout the original, treats
 12648	    "pepper" and "lovage" as one spice, whereas we have kept
 12649	    the two separate. He believed it to be a certain kind of
 12650	    pepper--_piper Ligusticum_. _Piper_, as a matter of
 12651	    fact, stands for pepper, and _Ligusticum_ is the herb,
 12652	    Lovage, an umbelliferous plant, also called
 12653	    _Levisticum_. The fact that the two words are here
 12654	    separated plainly shows that Torinus has been in the
 12655	    dark about this matter almost to the end.
 12656	
 12657	    One wonders why he did not change or correct this error
 12658	    in the preceding books. His marginal errata prove that
 12659	    his work was being printed as he wrote it, or furnished
 12660	    copy therefor--namely in installments. Since the
 12661	    printer's type was limited, each sheet was printed in
 12662	    the complete edition, and the type was then used over
 12663	    again for the next sheet.

 12803	    THE EXCERPTS FROM APICIUS
 12804	    BY VINIDARIUS
 12805	    THE ILLUSTRIOUS MAN
 12806	
 12807	_Apici Excerpta A Vinidario Viro Inlustri_
 12808	
 12809	FIFTH CENTURY
 12810	
 12811	
 12812	Vinidarius, a Goth, of noble birth or a scientist, living in Italy.
 12813	Vinithaharjis is the native name. Of his time and life very little is
 12814	known. It appears that he was a student of Apicius and that he made
 12815	certain excerpts from that book which are preserved in the uncial
 12816	codex of Salmasius, sæc. VIII, Paris, lat. 10318.
 12817	
 12818	Vollmer in his Apicius commentary says that Salmasius and his
 12819	predecessors have accepted them as genuine. Schuch incorporated these
 12820	recipes in the Apicius text of his editions, in appropriate places, as
 12821	he thought. This course cannot be recommended, although the recipes
 12822	should form an integral part of any Apicius edition.
 12823	
 12824	M. Ihm, who faithfully reprinted the excerpta in the Archiv f. lat.
 12825	Lex. XV, 64, ff. says distinctly: "These excerpts have nothing to do
 12826	with the ten books of Apicius, even if some recipes resemble each
 12827	other ..." and other researchers have expressed the same opinion.
 12828	Vollmer, however, does not share this view.
 12829	
 12830	If I may be permitted to concur with Vollmer, I would say that the
 12831	excerpts are quite Apician in character, and that in a sense they fill
 12832	certain gaps in the Apicius text, although the language is strongly
 12833	vulgarized which may be readily expected to be the case in the age of
 12834	Vinidarius.
 12835	
 12836	The recipes of Anthimus, written around A.D. 511 also confirm the
 12837	close relation existing between Vinidarius and Apicius. Anthimus was
 12838	the Greek physician to Theodoric I, (The Great), Frankish king living
 12839	in Italy. He was not acquainted with Apicius.

 12848	INDIAN SPIKENARD, ADDENA [3], CARDAMOM, SPIKENARD.
 12849	
 12850	    [1] _Pigmentorum_--_specierum_--spices. The old
 12851	    _pigmentum_ is really any coloring matter; the word,
 12852	    corrupted to pimento and pimiento is now used for sweet
 12853	    red pepper and also for allspice.
 12854	
 12855	    [2] _Cariofilu_--_cærefolium_--_Chærephyllon_; Fr.
 12856	    _Cerfeuille_; Ger. _Kerbel_. This should be among the
 12857	    herbs.

 12859	    [3] Not identified.

 12876	GARLIC, LEGUMES [2], MARJORAM [3], INNULA [4] SILPHIUM, CARDAMOM.
 12877	
 12878	    [1] Not identified. Perhaps the seed of thyme, though
 12879	    the word _bacas_ would be out of place there.
 12880	
 12881	    [2] _Ospera_, i.e., _Osperios_.
 12882	
 12883	    [3] _Samsucu_, i.e., _sampsuchum_ Elderberries?

 12892	HONEY, REDUCED MUST, REDUCED WINE, APIPERIU [1] RAISIN WINE.
 12893	
 12894	    [1] Not identified. We take it to be honey mead, or some
 12895	    other honey preparation, maybe, _piperatum_, pepper
 12896	    sauce.
 12897	
 12898	
 12899	OF NUTS [to be on hand]
 12900	  _DE NUCLEIS HOC_

 12988	    enumeration of recipe names, a summary of dishes
 12989	    contained in the excerpts.
 12990	
 12991	    There is considerable variation in the spelling of the

 13028	    [1] Either the vegetables and chicken of ℞ No. 468
 13029	    are combined with this dressing or a purée of the above
 13030	    cabbage, etc., is made, which will make this an integral
 13031	    dish. The instructions are vague enough to leave room
 13032	    for this choice; but there can be no doubt but what we
 13033	    have here a formula for a vegetable purée or a pudding,
 13034	    a genuine "Chartreuse," such as were prepared in the
 13035	    fancy moulds so popular in old Rome. The "Chartreuse,"
 13036	    then, is not original with the vegetarian monks of the
 13037	    monastery by that name, the Carthusians.

 13050	MAY BE AVAILABLE; ARRANGE EVERYTHING ALTERNATELY IN LAYERS [in a mould
 13051	or in a casserole]. CRUSH PEPPER AND LOVAGE WITH 2 PARTS OF OLD WINE,
 13052	1 PART BROTH, 1 PART HONEY AND A LITTLE OIL. TASTE IT; AND WHEN WELL
 13053	MIXED AND IN DUE PROPORTIONS PUT IN A SAUCE PAN AND ALLOW TO HEAT
 13054	MODERATELY; WHEN BOILING ADD A PINT OF MILK IN WHICH [about eight]
 13055	EGGS HAVE BEEN DISSOLVED; [next] POUR [this spiced custard] OVER [the
 13056	layers of vegetables and meats, heat slowly without allowing to boil]
 13057	AND WHEN CONGEALED SERVE [either in the casserole, or carefully
 13058	unmould the dish on a service platter] [2].
 13059	
 13060	    [1] It is interesting to note how the generic terms,
 13061	    _salacaccabia_ and _caccabina_ have degenerated here. In
 13062	    these formulas the terms have lost all resemblance to
 13063	    the former meaning, the original "salt meat boiled in a
 13064	    pot." Such changes are very often observed in the
 13065	    terminology of our modern kitchens, in every language.
 13066	    They make the definition of terms and the classification
 13067	    of subjects extremely difficult. They add much to the
 13068	    confusion among cooks and guests in public dining places
 13069	    and create misunderstandings that only an expert can
 13070	    explain.
 13071	
 13072	    [2] This dish affords an opportunity for a decorative
 13073	    scheme by the arrangement of the various vegetables and
 13074	    meats in a pleasing and artistic manner, utilizing the
 13075	    various colors and shapes of the bits of food as one
 13076	    would use pieces of stone in a mosaic. Of course, such a
 13077	    design can be appreciated only if the chartreuse is
 13078	    served unmoulded, i.e. if the cook succeeds in
 13079	    unmoulding it without damaging the structure.

 13091	
 13092	    [1] Derived from _garum_ or _œnogarum_, the wine
 13093	    sauce. These are supposed to be meat balls or cutlets
 13094	    prepared with garum, but the _garum_ is not mentioned in
 13095	    the formula. This also illustrates the interesting
 13096	    etymology of the word. It is not recognized in every-day
 13097	    ancient language because it is a typical technical term,
 13098	    the much complained-of _lingua culinaria_. We find,
 13099	    therefore, that--at least in this instance--_garum_ no
 13100	    longer stands for a sauce made from the fish, _garus_,
 13101	    but that _garum_ has become a generic term for certain
 13102	    kinds of sauces. Danneil renders _garatus_ with
 13103	    _lasaratus_, which is clearly out of place.
 13104	
 13105	    [2] In this instance, and in several others, and also
 13106	    according to Sueton. Cæs. fluids were weighed. What idea
 13107	    could be more practical, useful and more "modern" than
 13108	    this? Sheer commercial greed, stubbornness, indolence
 13109	    have thus far made futile all efforts towards more
 13110	    progressive methods in handling food stuffs,
 13111	    particularly in the weighing of them and in selling them
 13112	    by their weight. Present market methods are very
 13113	    chaotic, and are kept purposely so to the detriment of
 13114	    the buyer.
 13115	
 13116	    [3] The original: _et sic frigis_.--_Frigo_ is
 13117	    equivalent to frying, drying, parching; the word here
 13118	    has taken on a broader meaning, because the "frying"
 13119	    process is clearly out of question here. It appears that
 13120	    the terminology of _frigo_ and that of _asso_ in the
 13121	    next formula, has not been clearly defined. As a matter
 13122	    of fact, not many modern cooks today are able to give a
 13123	    clear definition of such terms as frying, broiling,
 13124	    roasting, braising, baking, which are thus subject to
 13125	    various interpretations.

 13237	
 13238	    The nature of this sauce is not quite clear. If properly

 13240	    mayonnaise, or a vinaigrette, depending on the mode of

 13257	    Rather an obscure term, owing to the diversity of
 13258	    spelling. We would call it a dish stewed in or prepared
 13259	    with wine, although wine is absent in the present
 13260	    formula. However, it is given in XIII, which bears the
 13261	    same name.
 13262

 13280	    inhabitant of Sardinia.
 13281	
 13282	    [2] The absence of detailed instructions as to the
 13283	    manipulation of the yolks, oil and vinegar is
 13284	    regrettable; upon them depends the certainty or

 13307	    _Bouillabaisse_, the famous Marseilles fish chowder. In
 13308	    addition to the above manner it is flavored with
 13309	    saffron. An excellent dish, especially with the

 13353	    an earthenware casserole; either of which may be used
 13354	    for service at the table.
 13355	
 13356	    It may be noticed how this manner of preparing fish has
 13357	    a tendency to preserve all the savory flavors and juices
 13358	    of the fish, a process in this respect both rational and
 13359	    economical.

 13373	THAT THE FISH BE ENTIRELY COVERED BY THIS LIQUOR SO THAT THERE MAY BE
 13374	SUFFICIENT JUICE DURING THE COOKING.
 13375	
 13376	    [1] The ancients considered the murena one of the finest
 13377	    of fish; the best were brought from the straits of
 13378	    Sicily. Rich Romans kept them alive in their fish ponds,
 13379	    often large and elaborate marble basins called,
 13380	    _piscina_, fattened the fish, kept it ready for use.
 13381	    Pollio fattened murenas on human flesh, killing a slave
 13382	    on the slightest provocation and throwing the body into
 13383	    the fish pond; he would eat only the liver of such
 13384	    murenas. This is the only case of such cruelty on
 13385	    record, and it has often been cited and exaggerated.
 13386	
 13387	    [2] Perhaps the sea-eel, or conger, according to Dann.
 13388	    Also very much esteemed. The witty Plautus names a cook

 13408	    According to our notion of eating, there is only one

 13410	    to cool off; the meat is then taken out of the shells;
 13411	    the above named ingredients are combined in a manner of

 13429	    [1] Dann. is undecided as to whether this is dates or

 13482	
 13483	    [2] Dann. is of the opinion that the pig is cooked in a

 13515	    [1] We would first mix the liquid components of this

 13540	    various spellings and meanings of _oxyzomum_. This is
 13541	    supposed to be a sour sauce or an acid preparation of
 13542	    some kind, yet this recipe does not mention acids. In
 13543	    fact, the presence of honey would make it a sweet
 13544	    preparation. We take it, the "garnish" contains the
 13545	    necessary vinegar or other acids such as lemon juice,
 13546	    wine, etc. _Oxyzomum_ is properly rendered "pickle."

 13611	BEEN RETIRED FROM THE POT WITH ITS OWN DRIPPINGS OR GRAVY.
 13612	
 13613	    [1] There being only liquids for this filling of the
 13614	    guts, a more solid substance, such as pork forcemeat,
 13615	    eggs, or cereals would be required to make an acceptable
 13616	    filling for the casings of the kid. Furthermore sausage,
 13617	    for such is this in fact, must be thoroughly cooked
 13618	    before it can be used for the filling of the carcass, as
 13619	    not sufficient heat would penetrate the interior during
 13620	    the roasting to cook any raw dressing.

 13632	THEM WITH A STRING. THEREUPON MAKE THIS PREPARATION IN WHICH THEY ARE
 13633	COOKED: CONSISTING OF OIL, SALT, WATER [5], DILL AND HEADS OF LEEKS.
 13634	
 13635	    [1] Cf. Summary of Dishes; term not identified, derived
 13636	    from the Greek, meaning to drive away all stomach ills.
 13637	
 13638	    [2] We use juniper berries today instead of cumin.
 13639	
 13640	    [3] Cf. note to ℞ 496, XXVIII.
 13641	
 13642	    [4] Thrush and other game birds of such small size are
 13643	    not emptied in the usual way: they are cooked with the
 13644	    entrails, or, the intestines are taken out, seasoned,
 13645	    sauté, and are either put back into the carcasses, or
 13646	    are served separately on bread croutons. In this
 13647	    instance, the necessary seasoning is introduced through
 13648	    the throat, a most ingenious idea that can only occur to
 13649	    Apicius.
 13650	
 13651	    [5] In other instances we have pointed out where a small
 13652	    amount of water was used to clarify the oil used for
 13653	    frying foods. The presence here of water leads us to
 13654	    believe that the thrush were not "cooked," i.e. "boiled"
 13655	    but that they were fried in a generous amount of oil;
 13656	    this would make the ancient process remarkably similar
 13657	    to the present European way of preparing thrush or
 13658	    fieldfare, or similar game birds.
 13659	
 13660	    For water used to clarify oil see note 3 to ℞ No.
