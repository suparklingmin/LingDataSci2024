IF BROTH HAS CONTRACTED A BAD ODOR, PLACE A VESSEL UPSIDE DOWN AND FUMIGATE IT WITH LAUREL AND CYPRESS AND BEFORE VENTILATING IT, POUR THE BROTH IN THIS VESSEL. IF THIS DOES NOT HELP MATTERS AND IF THE TASTE IS TOO PRONOUNCED, ADD HONEY AND FRESH SPIKENARD TO IT; THAT WILL IMPROVE IT. ALSO NEW MUST SHOULD BE LIKEWISE EFFECTIVE [6].
